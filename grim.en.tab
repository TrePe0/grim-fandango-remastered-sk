#year1commentary	
coal0101	Tim: Can you imagine actually pulling yourself up a little chain of ties that are as long as the, um... Like--
coal0102	Peter M: Well, that's what's great about-- And then I like the view down.
coal0103	Tim: He's so calm about it, too. He's like, "Hyup hyup hyup hyup, ah! Many stories." I mean part of it is, I guess, he probably won't die.
coal0104	Peter M: He's already dead, I was going to say. He's already dead. So it's really just--
coal0105	Tim: And I was thinking, does he have the muscles to do that? Or else... No, he doesn't have any muscles. He's just a living skeleton. How is he moving? He's magic.
coal0106	Peter M: His spirit is animating, yes.
coco0201	Tim: The computers in the game are, um, I think where you can see Peter Chan's "Twelve Monkeys"-like influence. Like Terry Gilliam mix of, like... I don't know if you call it steampunk, but there's a lot of analog big tube-type things combined with Art Deco and old-fashioned typewriter keyboards.
coco0202	Peter M: Well, they had "steam" and "punk" in those days, right? But they didn't actually call it steampunk, right?
coco0203	Tim: The nineties? I think we might have had steampunk back then. Oh yeah.
coco0204	Peter M: Jeez. See, I told you I was from the "Mad Men" era.
coco0205	Tim: I'm so glad they made a show about you guys.
cofe0101	Tim: I don't know why we chose Robert Frost for the balloon shape, either.
cofe0102	Peter M: Oh, that was genius--
cofe0103	Tim: I just knew that it would be hard to make Robert Frost.
cofe0104	Peter M: Yes! And also because-- I think the whole implication is that the clown is way, way beyond his pay grade, and he has disdain for all those around him. And so he makes shapes that his lowly audience--
cofe0105	Tim: I never even thought about that being a testimony to the skills of the clown. I thought of it as Manny being a smartass. 'cause he asked for it. He's like, "Oh yeah? Can you do Robert Frost?" And then, of course, the clown does it.
cofe0106	Peter M: But, see, that's a Chandler thing, too, because the detective is always smarter than sort of the world that he's in. So he's teasing the clown.
cofe0107	Tim: So to speak.
cofe0108	Peter M: Yeah, so to speak. 'cause he knows the clown knows what Robert Frost looks like.
coga0101	Julian: You hear reverb on the steps, and you hear the reverb on his voice. And that was real-time reverb in a time when we never did that. We always prebaked the files with reverb. Jeff really had to fight for, I think it was, like, five percent of the CPU. But now anything that happens in this garage goes through that reverb. And, like, to modern game folks--audio people--it's just totally basic. No big deal. But back then it was such a big deal! And he really had to jump through hoops for it, and it's so great.
coga0201	Tim: Mark Hamer-- I remember [him] animating Glottis coming out. And he had to put this thing called a lattice on his butt. And so, "What are you working on, Mark?" "Oh, I'm working on the Glottis butt lattice." And he was always working on the Glottis butt lattice to morph and squash and stretch his butt as it came out of the door. And so, three cheers to Mark Hamer and his Glottis butt lattice. Amazing work still remembered to this day.
coha0101	Bret: So this was the first scene in the game that we ever actually did with some test assets. So I had to-- This was when I was proving out, "Okay, yes, we can do this." It was this hallway scene. We had Manny running up and down. We had the security-cam kind of camera switching. We had text on the screen. We had animations. We had geolocation of the sound relative to the camera--the typing was down the hallway. And we had Manny running up and down. It was a really good test scene and it kind of came through at the very last second. Literally, I was compiling code as people ran in the room because I had an awful bug. Um, but this was sort of like proof that, yes, we have all the elements to make this work. This was the first scene ever put together. And notice in the scene Manny hardly ever clips behind anything, and that's partially because I didn't have z-buffers working yet. But it was good enough that when people saw it they were really impressed, and I was kind of surprised because I was like the new guy at LucasArts and I was kind of half-assing my way through this and somehow made everybody really impressed. At that point I thought, "Okay, we can do this."
coha0201	Tim: My writing has changed a lot since this. Like, I was really trying to write good dialogue here, which to me at the time meant a lot of puns and like, um, word play. Like, "This suit is-- This deck of cards is a lot like me: it's ragged around the edges but I've got more suits..." I forget what it is, but everything had to be this kind of, like, bon mot.
coha0202	Peter M: Well, that's kind of Chandleresque, too. I mean, you know...
coha0203	Tim: Kind of, but I think I ease off on it in act two. I think I just start writing-- Or, in year two, there's a lot more just normal talking. Which I think I kind of like a little bit more now. I mean, it's fun to have crazy word play like that but you can just kind of trip over yourself a lot--too much--if you focus on that, I think.
coha0301	Peter M: So is there a reason that a lot of people who are in administrative positions of power have New York accents? Is that a...
coha0302	Tim: Everyone in the, um, jazz era was from New York.
coha0303	Peter M: Well, yeah, that's true.
coha0304	Tim: A lot of people don't know that.
cole0101	Bret: The ties. When Manny later uses the ties to cross over to the roof. [Tim] wanted it to be more like a little, you know, a little bit less adventure game and more sort of skill game, where you had to kind of, you know, line up the ties and throw the lasso and hook it on the thing. And I'll be honest with you, that was technically not something I was prepared to do in any way, shape, or form. It was kind of all I could do to make the rest of the stuff work. So, um, the ties and the beavers were--and actually the shocks on the tree--were all supposed to be a little bit more dynamic than a lot of the canned stuff you typically get in adventure games. We just couldn't do it.
cole0201	Peter M: I always liked the music up on the ledge.
cole0202	Tim: Me too! It was very Bernard Herrmann--"Vertigo."
cole0203	Peter M: And it always made me feel like a little... Maybe it's 'cause I actually have a little bit of vertigo, or whatever you say.
cole0204	Tim: But isn't that-- That happens a lot in "Vertigo"--the movie "Vertigo." Like the, um...
cole0205	Peter M: Yep, yep. Yeah, it probably comes from that.
cole0206	Tim: That dreamy, falling sensation.
cole0207	Peter M: Well, I'm a huge Bernard Herrmann fan. How can you not be? He was the guy who really brought kind of a seriousness of classical music to scoring. I mean, the guys before... There were great composers before him, they were a little more sort of, kind of the entertaining aspect of orchestral music. I think he was more really very serious about it.
colo0101	Bret: Ah, elevator code. Elevator code is the worst, man. Door code in general.
colo0102	Kevin: So there was a door box that you would draw on the ground. That would have data attached to it that would trigger the art and the, uh...
colo0103	Bret: Well, it's like the old-- Like when you walk into a supermarket in the old days, they didn't have a IR thing that was pointing at you. They had like a pad on the ground. You would roll your cart or step on the pad on the ground and it would automatically open the grocery store for you. It's just like that. There's a little invisible box that, uh, you cross that triggers all that stuff.
colo0104	Kevin: And then all the fiddly bits of people step on the box, step off the box, step back on it, while the doors are opening and closing. Those doors were broken for a long time.
colo0201	Peter T: Savvy viewers will note that the lobby is based on a real building in San Francisco with Mexican architecture. Uh, or Mayan Deco architecture. 450 Sutter, yeah, which is an actual building... Which is the inspiration for the whole business. Yeah, San Francisco is kind of a-- There's a lot of Deco-ish stuff around town, and that was a big part of making this world look the way it looked.
como0201	Gaurav: So this was actually the art test I took. I had to make this whole scene in a day.
como0202	Dave: Really?
como0203	Mark: Did they pay you for that?
como0204	Dave: One day?
como0205	Gaurav: Barely. I was so scared.
como0206	Dave: How much did you get done?
como0207	Gaurav: Uh, I think almost all the geometry. In some cases it used to be an overnight render.
como0301	Tim: I love pneumatic tubes! If you ever read articles about old New York, there's a lot of stuff about how the tube system was... There was an interbuilding tube system, too.
como0302	Peter M: Oh, really?
como0303	Tim: I don't know how that could possibly work! And the tubes were sixteen inches in diameter, and they would shoot pneumatic messages, like, they'd push them between buildings. Now those tubes are there. They're thinking about using them for fiber-optics and stuff like that.
coos0101	Tim: I love that mural 'cause it's the three ways of travelling in the Land of the Dead: the car, the train, and the boat. There's no air travel in the Land of the Dead. No "Land of the Dead Airlines."
copk0101	Alex: Down in QA, we got on the project way, way earlier than we ever had on any other project and we would play the game with the concept art on the screen. But Manny was modeled, and done, and lit... Well, maybe he wasn't lit, I don't know, but he would zoom around the concept art, and it was all black and white. And uh, that's why I was...
copk0102	Paul: Oh, that would be neat!
copk0103	Alex: Yeah.
cost0101	Dave: I think the camera choices in this game were actually pretty fantastic as well. I don't know who was responsible for that. Was it storyboarded or...
cost0102	Mark: Was that you, Pete?
cost0103	Peter T: Yeah, probably. A little bit. A lot of stuff got worked out ahead of time, certainly. I mean because, you know, we didn't necessarily build full three-sixty 3-D worlds. I mean except for like the offices and stuff.
cotu0101	Dave: You know, the games we make nowadays we try to keep them real-time. And the environments will come in the tens of thousands of polygons, probably. But, uh, or at least under a hundred, I would say at least at the TellTale studio. But here they I think were almost unlimited, unless it crashed the machines all the time.
cotu0102	Peter T: Yes, it was unlimited, and it was like trying to render it on your iPhone, which was crazy.
cotu0103	Mark: He modeled like every single nut and bolt everywhere in there, and they were all high-res.
cotu0104	Gaurav: Yeah, I was about to say a certain amount of this was us not--
cotu0105	Dave: "It might get a close-up!"
cotu0106	Gaurav: ... really knowing and us not being efficient about how we set everything up.
cotu0107	Mark: As an animator, when you open one of these environments to animate in, you had to basically throw everything away except for the one thing that Manny touches or walks next to or something.
cobv0101	Bret: This scene, actually, this is, uh-- The beavers here are another good example of like, you know, why you have to have coroutines in games because, you--at least, in adventure games. You have to have like a script that just says, "How's this beaver going to behave? What's he going to do?" And at the time that people were making games, scripting engines weren't popular yet, you had a lot of games in C [programming language]. And somebody would've been trying to write in their game engine, in their game loop, "And go run the beavers now." In a scene like this you had to be able to take that and say, "This is how a beaver behaves. Right now I'm thinking like a beaver. How would a beaver-- He's going to crawl over here, he's going to chew on these things. Then he'll get tired, then he'll jump over here." Same thing with the pigeons and everything else. And that, again, I didn't have to think about the fact that they were needed. They were obviously needed. I mean, that's one of the things that SCUMM had made very obvious, like, you cannot make adventure games without coroutines. They didn't even call them coroutines, though. I mean, we didn't even know what to call them for a long time until--
cobv0102	Kevin: Threads.
cobv0103	Bret: They were just threads, yeah. And actually, well that was one of the early experiments. I actually tried to use actual Windows threads. 'cause this was a Windows game; it wasn't a DOS game. This was a Windows game. We can use actual threads! I initially did try and actually have different Lua threads, and it was like, it was just so heavyweight. Machines are so tight and it was so much overhead. And it was so complex. It was like, we need something lightweight. It needs to be really focused on what the game does.
cobv0201	Lleslle: This one was, um--
cobv0202	Julian: How could you ever cut this?
cobv0203	Lleslle: I know, but programmatically it was buggy. And it caused-- It was hard. No one understood how to solve this puzzle for quite a long time. And so I was like, "Look, you gotta pick something," and we hadn't started it yet. So this is a classic Tim technique. When you want to cut something, he will start putting it in the game. So that everything gets in. So, uh, yeah. Funny, funny.
cobv0301	Tim: They were-- We were like, "Where is the fire-- What is the flame source for the beavers?" And they were like, "Well, they have a nuclear core." They have a nuclear core. So they're thermonuclear flaming bone beavers.
cobv0302	Peter M: Yeah, you know, I have to say. Flaming bone beavers. I mean--
cobv0303	Tim: You would think that would be controversial. A band? A band name.
cobv0304	Peter M: Maybe, yeah.
cobd0101	Tim: I still remember writing a big justification about tank controls when I was pitching this. People were like, "Let's make it so the controls are more like Mario." Where you push-- No, no, point-and-click. I was thinking-- Tank controls I thought were superior to point-and-click at the time because when you're pointing and clicking you're distant from the screen, and the screen is this other thing that you're interacting with at your finger tips.
cobd0102	Peter M: Right, you're seeing--
cobd0103	Tim: But when you're doing tank controls, you feel like you are in the center of the character. The world is rotating around you. So when you think-- Instead of going, "I want to go on the left of the screen" or "I want to go on the right of the screen," you're saying, "I want to look at the thing to the left of me, and the thing to the right of me." And now I don't know if that was necessarily the right decision, but it's a good piece of evidence that you can somehow, sometimes make a really good argument for the wrong decision, and that's something to watch out for in life. You know what I mean? You can make a really compelling [case], and in fact win an argument, and be totally wrong.
cobd0104	Peter M: Winning an argument has nothing to do with being right, that's for sure.
cobd0105	Tim: Exactly, exactly. It's just being able to make a good case.
cotu0201	Tim: This line that he says a lot actually comes from the old IT guy at LucasArts. We'd say, "Hey, the server's down." And he goes, "The server's not down. It's never down. You just can't get to it right now."
cona0101	Lleslle: Well, this is the area that Tim and I would make a lot of jokes about because, you know. Producer-type person, I need to shorten the game. Cut it somehow. So this area, I would say, "Hey, we need to cut... the beavers. Does that make sense?"
cona0102	Julian: He's like, "No way, not cutting it."
cona0103	Lleslle: Well, he-- The whole time we'd fight about it, and it was that one kind of thing where, um... That was the story I told a little earlier, about the ship, you know? He said, "Lleslle, a game is like a ship, and the ship is going, and it's going to keep going until it stops." And I was like, what kind of logic is that? It has to finish at some point. So I was like, "Look, the beavers gotta go." They'd always be on the list. And he actually drew me little pictures on a napkin of, like, the armadillo, the beavers on fire. And he's like, "Why did you cut me, Lleslle? Please don't cut me, Lleslle." And he would just poke me.
cona0104	Julian: That's so funny.
cona0105	Lleslle: Yeah.
colb0101	Tim: This is like a callback to, um, "Those Brave Young Men and Their Jaunty Jalopies." You ever see that movie? "Those Outrageous Young Men and Their Flying Machines."
colb0102	Peter M: Oh, that I remember.
colb0103	Tim: They're these two crazy movies from the sixties, which were all about-- It was kind of like the "Wacky Races," but a real life version--
colb0104	Peter M: [singing] "Those magnificent men and their flying machines, ey!"
colb0105	Tim: It was kind of like "Wild, Wild, Wild World," or whatever--
colb0106	Peter M: "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World."
colb0107	Tim: Where all these people are chasing some crazy prize. But the cars in it always had things like that. I think that is a direct lift. Like, one of the cars would have these hydraulic shocks that lifted up, or just crazy extending things.
colr0101	Tim: What is this crazy music? How did you get it all warp-sounding?
colr0102	Peter M: Well, that's a great... See, remember that when I did all the themes for "Grim" I carried around a little handheld cassette, right? So I'd go for my hike in the hills in the morning and I'd carry my little cassette with me and if something popped in my head I would hum into it.
colr0103	Tim: And it dropped into a puddle?
colr0104	Peter M: Well, those cassettes... I don't know if you remember much about cassette technology, 'cause, you know--
colr0105	Tim: I remember cassettes. I made some mixtapes.
colr0106	Peter M: They didn't always last--especially the little, tiny ones--didn't last for a super long time. So if you used it all the time, which I did to compose, the machine heads--the mechanism--would start to wear out. Especially if it ran low on batteries. So yeah, that was me sitting at the piano, working on that theme for the Land of the Living which I recorded on a little handheld cassette, and then played it back with batteries that were running out. And recorded that into the digital system.
colr0107	Tim: That's awesome. Was that an accident at first? It ran out of power at an earlier time, writing something else?
colr0108	Peter M: You know, I can't remember. I think it was an accident, but I kind of meant to do it, too.
colr0201	Tim: In the Land of the Living, the people look horrifying because of that-- Have you ever seen that optical illusion where you take a picture of someone from a magazine, you cut rectangles out of their eyes and their mouth, and then turn them upside down? And they just look like demons.
colr0202	Peter M: Oh, yeah, yeah. Totally.
colr0203	Tim: That's the Land of the Living.
codo0101	Bret: There's a scene here. So there's the wine bottle there on the side. Or sorry, the bourbon bottle. And there's the taking a slug of his booze. That was actually-- We had lots of math problems early in the game where we were lining up camera angles, like you mentioned. These camera angles, if we had it off between the real-time and the pre-rendered stuff, things got kind of messy. That was one of the first scenes we had where Manny as one character goes and interacts with another item in the scene, and it also has to be placed very precisely in the scene because it has to appear to be on the shelf. And it was really difficult to coordinate, you know. He has to walk to exactly the right spot, line up to perform his animation. The cup has its own animation of flying through the air to his mouth. There's all these weird ways we handled it. I think we changed that later to handle it better, so that the cup was actually attached, we could swap it in. Blank out the one that was on the shelf, put in the one that was in his hand. It's like a magic trick. Originally, that was something we used to test it out and make it work. It was-- I remember spending days on that. Just being worried like, "Oh man, we're never going to get this to align perfectly between 2-D and 3-D."
codo0201	Peter T: I remember something about the mural. This would be the mural in, uh... What's that guy's name? The nemesis's office.
codo0202	Dave: Domino?
codo0203	Peter T: Domino, yeah. The mural on the ceiling of Domino's office. There was something. I think maybe that angle wasn't planned or something in the game, and then whoever did the textures for that room put this crazy mural on there. And so it was like, "We have to show the mural! We have to get that up there." I remember there was some sort of fiasco around that mural.
codo0204	Dave: Usually, it's the other way around. Usually artists put a bunch of beautiful work into something and then someone turns the camera the other way and doesn't show it.
codo0205	Paul: Right, exactly.
codo0301	Tim: How is he sweating without skin? So inaccurate. Tried to get it really accurate with the punching. You know: left, left, right, right, left, left, right... I think that's how you do it. Well, you don't just do one, two, one, two with the speed bag.
codo0302	Peter M: Yeah, I think you're right. Yeah it looks--
codo0303	Tim: In my boxing history.
codo0304	Peter M: My grandpa used to have a boxing bag in his basement. He showed me how it works once.
cosm0101	Darragh: That line right there, "Love is for the living. I'm only after her for one reason. She's my ticket out of here," that was the key line that Tony and I would always go back to, that kind of identified who that character was. The idea with Manny being a Hispanic Humphrey Bogart-- That line evoked "Casablanca" in many ways and, um, that was kind of just... We worked on that line longer than we should have. But it was just one of those that we just felt was important to kind of nail and help define Manny.
cosm0102	Clint: And you could see Pete's musical treatment of it. He kind of suspended the music, and had this little classical guitar melody that had a feeling of being like a pocket in time, to further highlight that line, yeah.
cogs0101	Tim: I never realized how weird it was that he gets locked into a room by his boss, which I don't think is legal.
cogs0102	Peter M: Oh, you know back in the thirties you could do all kinds of stuff. You know, rubber hoses for cops and so on. It was just fifty years after the Old West.
cogs0103	Tim: Whoa, that's weird to think about.
cogs0104	Peter M: Yeah.
cohq0101	Peter T: There's some concept art there in the PowerPoint.
cohq0102	Paul: Yeah, 'cause I remember I just took [Peter Chan's] stuff and, like, inverted it to make it look like a plan.
cohq0103	Peter T: Oh, really? You took someone else's textures and reused them.
cohq0104	Paul: Great artists borrow... No, wait. Good artists steal. Um, yeah.
cohq0201	Tim: Oh, the secretary has a dual identity! It's always lots of fun with dual identities. I like that Eva gets to have a little, like, um... She's got more going on that you thought she did.
cohq0202	Peter M: I love that, too. And I like that there's something fishy in the Department of Death, too. That's a good twist.
como0101	Darragh: This is one of the scenes where we had Tony and Maria Canals in working together. They're both from Cuba and had worked together before they were cast in Grim. So it was kind of fun to get the two of them together again and play off of each other, which is of course the way you'd like to do any game.
corf0101	Tim: I used to work at a doctor's office, and one of the jobs-- Just terrible jobs there. And one of them was the roof was covered in, like, six inches of pigeon guano up there. They had a flat roof like the roof of this building. And they're like, "Look, we gotta get that stuff off the roof. It's really, it's going to break the roof. There's so much pigeon crap on the roof." And I had to go up there with this flat shovel. It was kind of like cutting brownies out of a pan. I was just chopping up the bird poop and just scooping it up and throwing it off the roof. But in chopping it up I would occasionally find, like in sedimentary rock, like an archaeologist or a paleontologist, I would find the bones of a dead pigeon just inside this weird brownie of guano on the roof.
corf0102	Peter M: Wow.
corf0103	Tim: So I had my fair share of bad jobs.
corf0104	Peter M: This really, this was really a kind of therapy to get that traumatic experience--
corf0105	Tim: Yeah, there's not enough poop on the roof to make this really--
corf0106	Peter M: Well, it's hard to indicate that with the technology of the time. Kind of just like-- It's like if you did wind in a 8-bit game it just sounded like [8-bit wind noise]. It just sounded bad, you know.
corf0107	Tim: At least I got to clear the pigeons from the roof of my memories.
core0101	Tim: I really wanted to have this moment of Velasco bonding with Glottis through the magic of cars, talking about engines and stuff...
core0102	Tim: Cars bring people together. Talking about engines.
core0103	Tim: Because I never had sports--
core0104	Peter M: Internal combustion...
core0105	Tim: I never liked sports. I was not into the manly unifier of sports, but--
core0106	Peter M: Me neither.
core0107	Tim: Cars you can talk about with the toughest of dudes.
core0108	Peter M: That's true, that's true.
cori0101	Darragh: The character Celso is played by a really funny actor called Peter Lurie. When he came into the studio, the first day, he had this real look of apprehension about him. It turned out the word in Hollywood was that "Grim Fandango" was code name for "Star Wars: Episode I" casting. So when he was coming in for the project people were telling him, "You're going to be going in, and George Lucas is going to be there. They're going to be flying you up to the ranch!" He was terribly disappointed when he walked in and the only person in the studio was me.
cori0201	Peter M: When you run into Celso Flores again and there's that-- You know, he's always down and out and he's listening to this music on the radio while he's working, which is actually Hector's music. All of the-- Most of the jazz pieces are some variation on Hector's theme, and they're being piped in everywhere. Like every time you listen to something on the radio it's actually Hector's music and it's sort of this idea that Hector is behind everything and in control of all the-- Pulling all the strings of commerce, and then here's this little guy. Celso's mopping the floor and with this reminder that he's just a little guy in a big world with these big forces.
cori0202	Tim: That's awesome.
cori0203	Peter M: Does that sound too philosophical?
cori0204	Tim: I think that works on a primal level. I don't think I was conscious of that, but I think it was working.
cori0301	Tim: I love the tiling floor. It's my favorite part in this one. And the fact that it's a automat, which was part of a period reference, too. Like those ways that you-- There used to be these restaurants in New York where you'd go--or big cities--where you'd go in and the food was ready for you behind these little panels, and you would just open the door and take it. Which is an interesting way of serving stuff. Like just separate the server from the eater, I guess? I don't know.
cori0302	Peter M: Oh, that is, I never--
cori0303	Tim: Like you don't want to see the wait staff, so they're behind this wall, because of some weird social reason.
cori0304	Peter M: That is weird.
cori0305	Tim: And they didn't really have automats anymore, but I always thought that's what was behind that.
cori0306	Peter M: It does seem a little impersonal, doesn't it?
cosp0101	Tim: This is me playing with my own worst fears. I was realizing while we were making this game, randomly I was thinking about how nice it is that spiders can't fly. You know, with spiders-- Spiders are kind of icky, but they're on the wall. You can stay away from them. Don't go in the garage. Don't get fire wood, ever. You can stay away from spiders. But what if they could fly? What if you had instead of a bee buzzing around you or something, you had to worry about like, there's a black widow. Wouldn't that be creepy? So we made flying spiders in the game.
cosg0101	Clint: We coined a phrase called "McConnellian" ambience, meaning Pete McConnell. His style of ambience where you have a little idea, and then a completely different idea, and then a completely different idea, just sort of sequenced. The texture would get kind of big, and then it would get very small with a solo clarinet. Then something completely different would happen and then you'd get a little bassoon. And so these ideas would waft in and out like clouds, or just passing notions. It's a great way to keep the listener entertained but not get in his way. So we termed that a McConnellian approach to ambience.
cosg0201	Tim: I always like Glottis because he's just so pure in his-- I mean, he's by definition pure in that he's just the spirit of driving, kind of. Someone from the land itself. He has no-- Given nothing but a desire to drive and go fast, and all his motivations are about like, um, moving at high speed. He almost dies because he's going too slow at some point and he has to go fast again to come back to life. But he also obviously cares about friendship and Manny, and he's a very loyal character.
cotr0101	Clint: I remember in this room--as in several others, Julian--we used a sound ambience that we recorded using a contact microphone on various machines, like Coke machines, other vibrating devices or machine-like devices that produces a kind of interesting hum. If you put your ear up against a Coke machine, or-- I was just on the Golden Gate Bridge last week and I stuck my ear up against one of those three hundred, two hundred foot pylons and it's amazing the resonances that are going on in those type of resonant bodies. And we would record things like that and turn them into ambiences for some of the rooms.
cotr0201	Tim: Some of the things that we came up with for this game, like the, um... petrified forest. Petrified forest was right out of a Bogart movie, right? That comes from the name of a Bogart movie.
cotr0202	Peter M: And he's actually a gangster.
cotr0203	Tim: He's a bad guy in it, yeah. But, um, having these little things pumping-- I don't even know where this, like, came up with... I feel like in games now we try to make things kind of make sense. Like, oh, you go to a gas station, something you know that exists. But here it's a weird hydraulic pump factory with a counterweight on top of it for sucking something out of the marrow out of these trees.
cotr0204	Peter M: Oh, right.
cotr0205	Tim: But it was all worth it 'cause it was satisfying to see Glottis spin around on the top of it.
cotr0206	Peter M: I like the environmental message myself.
#year2commentary	
cocb0101	Lleslle: And just the amount of research that went into all of this, 'cause I just remember Tim going to every film noir movie, ever. And we would just-- All the time, there would be something to do. And he's like, "Wanna go to the movies?" And it was just, I mean you can see it. The dark shadows, and then the music. I mean, everything is just so film noir and really pulls you in.
cocb0102	Darragh: Yeah, and I remember us all going to see "Casablanca." I think it was in The Castro Theatre. It was one of those old San Francisco theaters. I forget which one it was, but it was, a whole gang of us went.
cocb0103	Lleslle: Yeah, remember-- Did you guys go to the, um, Golden Gate Fields for the horse races?
cocb0104	Darragh: I didn't do that.
cocb0105	Clint: I wish.
cocb0106	Lleslle: That was part of it, 'cause I think there were some scenes around that. And that was just fun, I mean, just the research trips.
cocb0107	Darragh: Yeah.
cocb0108	Lleslle: Those were fun.
cotw0101	Tim: You hear the cats racing? We were always so sad that we never showed the cat races, but that was for budget reasons, obviously. We didn't want to cut the actual cats. But I wanted to have giant cats running on a track... Like that!
cotw0102	Peter M: And the idea of cats racing, being herdable enough to race is pretty... Why cats?
cotw0103	Tim: Um, why cats? There was a... God, I don't remember. Why cats? That's a good idea.
cotw0104	Peter M: I mean, I just remember making the music, going [cat yowling noises] at some point, 'cause you're near the kitty litter.
cotw0105	Tim: Mm hm, mm hm.
cotb0101	Bret: You know, there are all these background scripts that do things as you enter a room. It's like it's, you know, "Start all these scripts when you enter the room. Do all these backgrounds actions." Then we leave the room, supposed to stop all those scripts. And it was all left to chance--left to programmer error. And, uh, there was one. We were talking about this earlier. There's a script that runs the cat races, and it runs the announcer for the cat races. And it actually, true to Tim's attention to detail he wanted it to actually simulate cat races, and--
cotb0102	Kevin: There are actual cat races going on.
cotb0103	Bret: There are cats that are being raced and they, the same name will show up and you'll hear this cat getting ahead of the other one. I think Chris Purvis did that.
cotb0104	Kevin: Yeah, and the odds are real. The winnings are real. Just...
cotb0105	Bret: Manny's wallet fills up during the course of the game... No, the cat races are running and so in the background the announcer is running, and it's the simulation of these cat races being run. And, um, yeah they never killed that script. So you play the rest of the game from that cat scene and the cat race simulator script is always running.
cotb0106	Kevin: Yes, from the moment the cat races start to the end credits of the game.
cotb0107	Bret: To the end of time.
cotb0108	Kevin: The cat race simulation is going on in the background.
cotb0109	Bret: There are still kitties racing today.
cotb0110	Kevin: Yes.
cobk0101	Dave: In the final version of the game, are the backgrounds actually just pre-rendered flats?
cobk0102	Peter T: Yes, they are.
cobk0103	Dave: See, that's amazing to me 'cause we live in a world of 3-D now. We're used to floating the camera around inside of these things. But, you know, once you chose your camera angle to pre-render something, that was it. There you go.
cobk0104	Peter T: No, it's Manny walking around in a blank 3-D room with z-depth data to clip him in front of the stuff that he needs to clip in front of.
cobb0101	Tim: I'm a strong believer in things that should be-- When you're making stuff, it should be something that could only have been made by you, or in that group of people and at the time you made it, in the place you made it.
cobb0102	Peter M: Yes.
cobb0103	Tim: You know? I think "Grim" is definitely that case. Like, only-- That's one of the great things about "Grim." I think it's a collection of amazing artists, like you, and the visual artists, and the programmers, and the actors. And everything that came together for that game was just such a-- Was almost overwhelming distraction of amazing artists coming together. Like, "Oh my God, look at that background! Oh my God, listen to this music! Oh my God, listen to that voice!" So I think it makes that game really special. But it also has a lot of personal details that are just kind of woven into it that makes it. So like even if we were making this game from scratch, with the same intentions today, it would just be completely different.
cobp0101	Tim: I don't know why there's so much, uh, union jokery in games that I've worked on. But I've always found it, um, maybe because it was a big part of, like, movies of that era, like "On the Waterfront." You know, and not so much unions but mobster corrupt unions.
cobp0102	Peter M: Right.
cobp0103	Tim: There's always a big part of that, you know, going on. And then also, like, worker/anti-worker Communist themes going on. Like, it was all tied together. And I don't know if that all sprung out of "On the Waterfront", or...
cobp0104	Peter M: Well, "On the Waterfront" though was kind of, um... I mean, it was... sort of championing the... whatever, the plight of the working man, but it also was talking about the dark side of the union thing, for sure.
cobp0105	Tim: But it was a corrupt union, it was--
cobp0106	Peter M: Yeah, it was.
cobp0107	Tim: It was a mob-run deal.
cobp0108	Peter M: That's true.
cocc0101	Lleslle: So Tim created a character which I very much appreciate. I love her. Her name is Lupe, and she happens to be a little bit based on me and my idiosyncrasies. And so when he--I remember one time we were hanging out, and he told me, he's like, "See, how can you tell me that I don't understand our relationship? Like, I can write about it." And I was like, "What are you talking about?" And he said, "See, she's super organized, nobody listens to her, but she has a lot of really important things to say. And, see, we need her! And that's what you've realized."
cocc0102	Darragh: That's awesome.
cocc0103	Lleslle: So I was like, "Oh, I love you." And she does karate kicks. That was the best 'cause I like to punch people. And so if you notice sometimes--I don't know if they have it in here--but she, uh, she punches in the air. She does air punches.
cocc0104	Clint: That's awesome.
cocc0105	Darragh: She was really easy to cast because I had such a great frame of reference for her.
cocc0106	Lleslle: Oh, nice. Thank you!
cocc0201	Tim: These scenes are from the production of the game in a way, where Lleslle would come to me like, "Look what I made! I made a chart of every single scene in the game, plus every single actor, and I coded it. Yellow means Manny's in it, and blue means this prop is in it," and she was so excited about these things that she did, and this character's doing the exact thing.
cocc0202	Peter M: Yup.
cocc0203	Tim: You have to take things from your life and put them in your work, you know. Even though they don't really mean anything to anybody else.
cocc0204	Peter M: Well, then that just means work will be about life, rather than life being about work, right?
cocc0205	Tim: Exactly, exactly.
codh0101	Paul: No, and I think this is one of my first sets. Oh, yeah! I remember this is-- Both of those were... Well, it was one of the first [environments] that I ever modeled. And again, it was very simple. Very simple geometry.
colm0101	Darragh: That's Kay Kuter. And Kay was, I don't know, late seventies, early eighties. Um, and big long gray beard... And he was a raging smoker. So you'd have to break him every forty-five minutes, otherwise he'd start getting into a really bad mood. And on one of those sessions, we were doing-- He plays the croupier later on, where he speaks French and English. It's just, he delivers the numbers. We were behind on time and so I sort of pushed him to an hour, and all of a sudden I found myself in an argument with Kay over how to pronounce "twenty" in French. And so I was like, "It's definitely time for a smoke break. [I'll just go] and get out of here."
cosd0101	Darragh: That's Raphael Sbarge, who, um-- He was actually the main character in "Knights of the Old Republic," in the original game. But Raphael, he's a big on-camera guy. Hadn't really done a lot of voice-over. And there's a scene later on where he's addressing all of the workers. And the thing about Raphael is that he physically performs when he's in the studio. So as he was addressing the field he kept on going off mic. So the engineer's like, "Oh, we gotta keep him on mic." So I said, "Hey, Raphael. You know, can you stay on mic?" He's like, "Oh! Really sorry, really sorry." We re-rolled and all of a sudden his energy just went [plummeting sound]... down."
cosd0102	Julian: Oh, interesting.
cosd0103	Darragh: It just wasn't working the same way, so we pulled out another two mics and put them out.
cosd0104	Julian: Oh, that's great!
cosd0105	Darragh: He could then go, you know, "You are the fat cats of industry!" and he could kind of move his head, and we still caught it. So then we just cut around, um, the three tracks to get the final take."
cosd0106	Julian: Oh, that's so crazy.
cosd0107	Darragh: Yeah... He's a great actor.
cosd0201	Tim: This is where-- I had never heard of actual Seabees before, and someone made that-- I talked about how there could be these bees down there. And they're like, "Oh, like Seebees!" And I was like, "What? What are Seabees?"
cosd0202	Peter M: Yeah, they were a Navy thing.
cosd0203	Tim: And, wait, does that come from the letters CB? like...?
cosd0204	Peter M: I don't know.
cosd0205	Tim: "Construction brigade" or something?
cosd0206	Peter M: Like Jeep comes from "General Personnel Vehicle," yeah.
cosd0207	Tim: So, and this bee is called Terry because the character from "On the Waterfront"--Marlon Brando's character named "Terry." Um, so that's where we got all that stuff.
code0101	Alex: But I do remember-- Did you guys notice, or do you remember this, that you couldn't solve this puzzle if you had a fast computer?
code0102	Paul: Really?
code0103	Alex: Yeah so right after the game shipped computers, you know, got better, right? And so the processors were much, much faster. And there's a timing element to this puzzle. And if your computer was too fast there was not enough time to actually execute and do the puzzle.
code0104	Dave: That's pretty awesome.
code0105	Alex: Yeah, so that was a bummer.
code0106	Dave: And not awesome.
code0201	Tim: This was our first 3-D game, and it's funny to see how many puzzles are about the physical properties of things. As opposed to, in a 2-D adventure game you would never make something based on the shape of something, or leverage. Like that whole puzzle was very physical, like you had to move these two objects and stop them from sliding past each other, and the fork lift jacked up on its back wheels. I think we were just so excited to be in a world of physical stuff, or maybe because we were in a world of physical stuff we had to actually make it physically realistic.
coev0101	Paul: I think we're going to come up to Gaurav's set that I destroyed-- That I destroyed two weeks of Gaurav's work, um, by trying to learn how to 3-D model. And somehow I ended up erasing two weeks of his work. It was the fish place that you had to redo.
coev0102	Gaurav: Oh yeah, the elevator!
coev0103	Paul: Yeah, the elevator and that place with the fish.
cose0101	Bret: To some extent, "Grim Fandango" is a bit of a mutt. It's got pieces of "Jedi Knight," it's got pieces of SCUMM, it's got pieces of "Outlaws." It's got pieces of, you know it's got iMUSE coming in, it's got the Lua language. So it was a game kind of made-- You know for all the technical challenges in it, a lot of pieces were sort of pre-existing, and kind of, it was a matter maybe of a new era of game development where you don't write everything from scratch, but you kind of put it together in the best possible way.
cose0102	Kevin: Well, and one of the side effects of that was since we had pretty robust solutions to video playback and rendering and art pipes in front of us, it really, a lot of the effort--aside from just making everything, all the blocking and tackling working--was spent in on how to make making games like this convenient and producible and artist-friendly, and uh... You know, you had built some tools that were really unlike the things that appeared in Renderdroid or Smush or some of the technologies it was built on. So it's a bit of a mutt in that we borrowed a bunch of really great technology, but there was also a lot of really innovative stuff.
cohl0101	Julian: Well, I remember--speaking of VO--I remember you casting this, and then I remember you vanishing. And you were gone for so long, recording this.
cohl0102	Darragh: Yeah, I was down in-- Actually, it was the one time we rented an apartment rather than stay at a hotel. I was down in LA recording this for six weeks, and then I was book-ended on either side with two weeks for two Lucas Learning projects. And so it was, uh...
cohl0103	Julian: Yeah, you just moved away.
cohl0104	Darragh: Yeah, yeah. It was a long time.
cohl0201	Mark: Is that cat actually modeled, or is that a painting?
cohl0202	Paul: No, that's a modeled cat. That's a--
cohl0203	Mark: The lighting is so soft, it's...
cohl0204	Paul: I think I might've even-- Oh, please, please, did I do that? Did I model that cat? I might've modeled that cat.
cohl0205	Mark: It's a cool-looking cat, just the lighting--
cohl0206	Paul: Oh, thank you.
cohl0207	Dave: [with accent] Is one sexy cat.
cohl0301	Tim: Wait, why did-- How did Glottis leave the piano-playing thing and come down here? Oh, you got him the pass. You gave him a pass.
cohl0302	Peter M: Right, and now he's a high roller.
cohl0303	Tim: And he's an alcoholic and a gambler because of you. But it's all for a good cause: adventure game-playing.
colx0101	Tim: I mean, that was always my favorite piece of concept art, was the flowers flying off the lighthouse.
colx0102	Peter M: Yes!
colx0103	Tim: This lighthouse is always so beautiful.
colx0104	Peter M: Yeah.
colx0105	Tim: And, um, a lot of those noir stories just have these really hard luck characters who don't get a break. And you know, the private eye's trying to solve the story, but they'll meet someone along the way who just gets bumped off and it's not their fault, and they just get wrapped up in things and--
colx0106	Peter M: Yeah, like the little two-time crook in--or two-bit crook--in, uh, "The Big Sleep," who drinks the poison but doesn't spill the beans, as it were, yeah.
colx0107	Tim: And Lola's one of those, um--
colx0108	Peter M: Lola's one of those characters.
colx0109	Tim: -- those victims. But you get to learn a lot!
colx0110	Peter M: Who's faithful but down and out.
colx0201	Bret: So all the water in year two was a mess. And I was actually very unhappy about the water because they loved making realistic-looking water, and they wanted to use all these shaders in Softimage to make the water look awesome. Have waves and everything. And so there's all these scenes, like this lighthouse scene, where there's like huge amounts of the screen are just undulating water, which compresses terribly for Smush and video. It was just awful. And that's all through this part of year two and I kept-- I got so freaked out because I thought that we'd never be able to do anything if we're just having every background-- We might as we all make every background be a full running movie at this rate.
colx0202	Kevin: Yeah, it was like for the film industry--where Softimage was mostly being used--water was kind of the soup du jour. It was-- Everybody was doing water.
colx0203	Bret: "How good is your water?"
colx0204	Kevin: Yeah, and so you would fire up Softimage and it could do all this amazing water simulation.
colx0205	Bret: I remember arguing with Peter [Tsaykel] about it, 'cause Pete wanted to have, you know, these angles where you would see a bunch of the water. Like, "You can't do it! Don't do it." He's like, "No, you've got to be able to see the water." And then we'd have like this, you know, three-quarters of the screen was just this undulating water. And they're big, you know, they're movies and they're big and awesome.
colx0206	Kevin: So there you can see some of the artifacts on the spotlight.
colx0207	Bret: Yeah.
colx0208	Kevin: Where it gets all bandy. That's just a--
colx0209	Bret: 16-bit, baby.
colx0210	Kevin: Yeah, a result of the video compression, and the water would do that.
colx0211	Bret: Yeah, you can see the frame rate on the background doesn't match, I think because we tried to make that one smaller. That lighthouse is just such a mess. We actually made it smaller. I think we ran at a lower frame just so we could actually fit it in memory.
colx0301	Tim: It goes from the super traumatic moment of the flowers and her death, and then all of a sudden there's this tongue on a card. The numbers are important, that's all I'm going to say. But "lengua"-- Around this time I went to a, um-- I remember going to a festival, a street festival. Carneval festival in The Mission. And drinking a lot of beer, and then I think the more drunk you are in the sunshine at a festival, the more likely you are to eat tongue tacos. That's my personal theory. So I ordered, um-- I was like, "What's a 'lengua'?" And they're like, "It's tongue." I was like, "Give it to me!" And it was delicious.
colx0302	Peter M: Of course it is!
colx0303	Tim: Super tender.
colx0304	Peter M: I was going to say... See, you're talking to the wrong guy.
colx0305	Tim: Delicious. I liked it so much that we put the "lengua" in here. So good. I recommend everyone eat some tongue.
colx0306	Peter M: Yeah, I mean be consistent here.
colx0307	Tim: It doesn't lick you back, if that's what you're worried about.
colx0308	Peter M: Exactly, and it's--
colx0309	Tim: You think it's going to be all tough, like your own tongue.
colx0310	Peter M: No, no.
colx0311	Tim: And you hate biting your own tongue, but...
colx0312	Peter M: No... There is a little bit of worry about biting someone else's tongue, that's true. There's something a little...
colx0313	Tim: Or that it's tasting you.
colx0314	Peter M: Yeah, yeah.
cohh0101	Alex: How big were those, when you drew them? Like the posters and the murals and stuff.
cohh0102	Paul: We could actually work rather big.
cohh0103	Dave: Did you have Photoshop back then?
cohh0104	Paul: We had Photoshop, but you... I don't know if we had layers back then.
cohh0105	Gaurav: Oh, we had layers.
cohh0106	Paul: We did-- Oh we had layers, but maybe only--
cohh0107	Dave: Paul just didn't know what they were.
cohh0108	Paul: No! But I think, too, you only had one undo, or maybe two undos.
cohh0109	Mark: Oh, wow.
cocn0101	Paul: Oh, wow! I forgot about that mural. That was supposed to be--
cocn0102	Alex: Wow, that's really good.
cocn0103	Paul: Oh, well, thank you. I did that.
cocn0104	Alex: Did you?
cocn0105	Paul: Uh, no I did. But it was based on, you know, like a Gustav Klimt. But then I also did those really bad textures on the roulette wheels, and uh...
cocn0106	Dave: Oh, they're fine.
cocn0107	Paul: Oh... But I remember Adam Schnitzer actually getting angry at me. He was like, "Don't paint light in the paintings."
cocn0108	Dave: Who got angry with you?
cocn0109	Paul: Oh, not really angry at me. He only--
cocn0110	Dave: It probably felt the same way as when Kim said, er, Tim said, "Manny's not cool enough sliding down the banister! Just make it cool... Canadian animator."
cocn0111	Paul: Heh, what's that aboot?
cocn0112	Dave: That's now so not cool.
cocn0201	Tim: Chowchilla Charlie.
cocn0202	Peter M: Oh, yes.
cocn0203	Tim: That name comes from an actual person I know who was from Chowchilla, which no one remembers anymore. But when I was a kid, an entire school bus full of children was kidnapped in the town of Chowchilla. Do you remember that? In California--
cocn0204	Peter M: No, wow.
cocn0205	Tim: A school bus full of kids was kidnapped, and the people demanded ransom. And it was crazy to think about. It was on the news, it was... Chowchilla, everyone was talking about these kids. And eventually they were found and rescued, and I don't believe they were hurt, so I can talk about that story now. And all the kids went home. But, um, and then years later I just, um, a friend of ours was dating this guy named Charlie, and he was from Chowchilla. And I was like, "Oh wow, were you on that bus?" He's like, "No, I was sick that day. I was sick, I didn't go to school that day, and so I didn't get kidnapped."
cocn0206	Peter M: Wow.
cocn0207	Tim: We always referred to him as "Chowchilla Charlie," and he's now in the game as Chowchilla Charlie, even though his personality is not as sleazy as this character. He's a fine, outstanding--although very lucky--guy.
cocn0208	Peter M: Yeah.
cocn0209	Tim: But this is our Peter Lorre character.
cocn0301	Peter M: Manny's music--the "Casino Calavera" music--is uh, that was a big moment for me doing the score because it was done fairly early on. And it kind of, it determined a lot of other stuff. Just sort of stylistically. Get that sort of Gene Krupa thing going on in the beginning, and--
cocn0302	Tim: Gene Krupa?
cocn0303	Peter M: Yeah, one of the great drummers of all time.
cocn0401	Tim: I always wanted to have a really international flare. I guess because "Casablanca" was very international, but I also love the game, "Last Express," the Jordan Mechner game. "Last Express": you're on a train and there's a lot of listening to conversations that are not presented at full volume, because you're eavesdropping. You're walking down the hallway and you hear someone talking in a room. But they would often be very quiet, but also sometimes in another language, like French, or German or something. And just the idea of, like, overhearing a quietly spoken French conversation was so neat in that game that we tried to have people talking in other languages in here. Like the croupier in the game where he's only speaking French, I believe.
cocf0101	Tim: So this is one of the parts, um, in the game that was very inspired by "Gilda." You ever seen "Gilda?" Um, I think Rita Hayworth.
cocf0102	Peter M: No.
cocf0103	Tim: Uh, it's a great noir movie--
cocf0104	Peter M: I'm just going to go home and see it now.
cocf0105	Tim: It's amazing, and it's the scene that you always see when they show Rita Hayworth, where she just flips her hair up and says, "Who, me?" Have you ever seen that...? So anyway, it's about a, um-- It's set in a resort town where there's a casino, and the main character... There is a... The main character's working in a casino and there's this kind of corrupt local law enforcement officer who shows up every night. And the way he gets paid off by the casino, to not bust it, is he always comes and bets on number two at a certain table. And then they always give him his money, and number two always wins and stuff. And so that, I think it's the same number in this game. We always use number two.
cocf0201	Peter M: When we leave the diner for the last time, there's a sort of a moment with the-- Just kind of a technical and sort of dramatic moment with the music where the radio, the music on the radio is playing and there's going to be a little bit of a cut and then there's-- You go to this cutscene music, which takes... It's supposed to be sort of a seamless break from the game music to the cutscene music. And then the music kind of comes out of the radio and it's not, doesn't sound like it's on a radio anymore. It's the music of people's, you know, dreams and wishes.
comx0101	Tim: Rubacava is named after a girl I knew in the fourth grade. Her last name was Rulbacava. There's a fun fact for you.
comx0102	Peter M: Wow.
comx0103	Tim: She's married now. Doesn't use it anymore, so I get to use it.
comx0104	Peter M: You're keeping it alive.
comx0105	Tim: Mm hm.
comg0101	Dave: How was the lighting handled on the characters in each environment?
comg0102	Dave: Does anybody remember that?
comg0103	Peter T: I think, uh, however we were able to set up a couple of lights. I think that was it.
comg0104	Paul: Yeah, because wasn't there some information, that you guys would take the set-- Because didn't we have to save a copy of our sets with, like, the key light and the fill. Or just-- I thought we would save a version of the very simple...
comg0105	Peter T: That's possible, yeah. As like a starting place, but I mean it was all very kind of rudimentary.
comg0106	Dave: And you had to be really strategic with, you know what is the best use of a minimal amount of lights to accommodate the character in the entire scene that he's got to be in.
comg0107	Peter T: There was no-- I mean for all this stuff, there was no road map or procedure for like, oh, this is how you do 3-D forests, or light characters. I mean we had to make everything up and solve every problem to get everything to happen pretty much in this-- So there's a lot of just on-the-fly, different people figuring stuff out per scene, how to make something work. And as a result, some things work better than others.
comg0201	Tim: Oh, Membrillo... My brother actually makes "membrillo," which is a quince jelly that you eat with cheese. "Membrillo" means quince. Why are you looking at me like that?
comg0202	Peter M: Sure doesn't sound like it.
comg0203	Tim: "Membrillo."
comg0204	Peter M: Ah, "membrillo!" That's different.
comg0205	Tim: Yeah. What did you think I said?
comg0206	Peter M: [laughter]
cohp0101	Tim: Here we're being very insensitive to claustrophobics. And French people. Probably would never do it today.
cohp0102	Peter M: Well, the Twitter-- Just think of the Twitter response from the claustrophobic French people, right?
cohp0103	Tim: Mm hm.
copc0101	Bret: Okay, I remember at the time it was a big debate. Like, "Should we require P100 or P133?" Like, Pentium 100, Pentium 133. It's like, "Nope, your target platform is whatever was on sale at CompUSA for five hundred bucks last year."
copc0102	Kevin: It's like a P70.
copc0103	Bret: Yeah, it's like what the-- You know P60 I think is what we ended up with as the minimum spec. We ended up going for P90 at the end. But it was one of those things where it's like those kind of constraints, where it's like you really could pull it off with all the kinds of machines we had in the company, but the average consumer who we wanted to sell the game to did not have a machine like that. That's one of the vagaries of the PC market that still persists.
copc0104	Kevin: Yeah, and you wouldn't, you know when you think about "Grim" you wouldn't necessarily think, but there's like all hand-coded assembly [programming language] rasterizers in here. There's hand-coded assembly blitters in here. Um, lots of, like, layout asset management. This was a-- This was a tricky game to optimize and to get running acceptably on the kind of machines that people were going to be running it on. But it doesn't come off like the same technical challenge as a "Jedi Knight" or something like that. And it wasn't.
copc0105	Bret: Different kind of technical challenge. Much more, kind of iterative.
copc0106	Kevin: It was really getting all this weird stuff happening at the same time.
copi0101	Dave: I always remember when finishing an animation, you know I'd show it to Pete [Tsaykel] or something, and he'd be like, "Yeah, that's cool." And then we'd always have to show it to Tim. And Tim's feedback... was interesting. He always-- I don't know whether he likes them, I never knew whether he liked something or not, but it always ended with some kind of joke, or sarcastic comment. Which was always fun.
copi0102	Paul: I remember one time showing Pete something. He said, "Well, I don't like it, but I don't know why." And... Which is the most helpful criticism that you can ever get, um, because you don't know how to fix the thing. But I'm being facetious.
copi0201	Tim: We wanted them to show-- Eventually, you're going to see him do a bee dance, which we were really proud to get. I had to actually do some dancing for the animators to get that to... be accurate as possible. 'cause you know when bees find pollen, or a bunch of flowers, they fly back to the hive and then they shake their abdomens in a certain way which tells people what-- It helps leads the other bees.
copi0202	Peter M: That's right, yeah.
copi0203	Tim: So when Terry is trying to lead the, um-- This right here, he's like trying to lead the other bees, and so he gives them a speech and then he shakes his abdomen a little bit to, uh, tell everybody where to go. Shake shake shake--I can do that dance really well.
cosi0101	Clint: One thing for a sound designer, for a composer. When the story is great and the writing is great, and the pacing is great--whether it's a film or a game--you can't help but weigh in in a successful way yourself because there is this flow already, and you're just participating with it and enhancing it. One of the jobs of a composer especially-- In a game like this, a lot of time passes and you need to entertain the listener and provide musical interest, but it has to also last for a very long time without being tiresome. And I think Pete did a great job at striking a balance between a great deal of musical interest but also kind of hanging back and taking its time and letting the story unfold. Letting the player concentrate on the game.
cosi0201	Tim: And uh, so that guy--Toto Santos, which is the name of the All Souls' Day--that was one important casting thing that meant so much at the time, and um, I love "The Usual Suspects."
cosi0202	Peter M: Yes.
cosi0203	Tim: There's a burn victim at the very beginning of the [film], a guy who was burned on a ship.
cosi0204	Peter M: Right.
cosi0205	Tim: And he's in the bed, and he's the first guy who says, "Keyser Söze."
cosi0206	Peter M: Got it, right.
cosi0207	Tim: He's this Hungarian or Polish guy. And we got that actor to do Toto Santos's voice, 'cause I was like, "I want him to sound like that guy from 'The Usual Suspects!'" And so if you listen to him he's just--
cosi0208	Peter M: That's awesome.
cosi0209	Tim: I just, I wanted to have him say, "Keyser Söze," in the game, but he doesn't.
cosi0301	Lleslle: I love how all the characters have very distinct voices that match their personality and their look. Like, how much would Tim give you direction and how much was your direction, um, influencing?
cosi0302	Darragh: Well, ideally when you go through the process you um, you know you have character pictures along with the audition copy and we would send that out to the various agencies, and the auditions would come back. It kind of, the process kind of does that for you because you're listening to the auditions and you're looking at the picture and you narrow it down to like, you know, a handful of candidates and then sort of, we'd sit down with Tim and... You know, just go through them and sometimes there's only one choice. You just know it.
cosi0303	Lleslle: Right. It's just so... great. All of them.
cosi0304	Darragh: What you do is you cast for like the major characters and then use that same talent pool with a lot of the smaller characters. And so that's why Kay [Kuter] is, you know he was cast for Velasco, but then the croupier just was one of those that's like, okay, well, that fits. He works.
cosi0305	Lleslle: So you let the actors pretty much kind of come up with their character as well, when they look at the picture?
cosi0306	Darragh: Yeah, yeah. Like for those secondary characters, they're totally undefined when you're in the studio and so you just kind of sit there, look at the picture... Look at the lines, talk about it, dial a voice in. And then go.
cosi0307	Lleslle: Yeah, just create... Ah, I love it! It's just creative everywhere, you know? Like through the whole thing. Not just with us but even with the actors and stuff like that. You really are like watching a movie. It's amazing.
cosi0308	Darragh: You really want that relationship between sort of the voice-over director and the actor to be collaborative and allow them the freedom to bring stuff to the table, and try things and, um, it just adds a lot.
cosl0101	Darragh: This is Pamela Segall, who plays Bobby on "King of the Hill." She's quite a character. She has a minivan with flames on the side.
cosl0102	Julian: Oh, yes.
cosl0103	Darragh: And a skull on the, uh, the front where it replaces-- I don't know what brand it is, but let's say it's Chrysler or somebody. And so instead of the Chrysler logo there's a skull and crossbones. She's pretty funny.
cosl0104	Julian: Did she just do this as one big long...?
cosl0105	Darragh: Yeah, all one take so she could build and build.
cosl0106	Julian: Yeah, yeah.
cosl0107	Darragh: You know, let it sort of ebb and flow.
cosl0108	Clint: And obviously, Pete's [McConnell] quotation of "There's No Place Like Home" is something we all admired in Carl Stalling, who did a lot of the compositions for the "Merrie Melodies" Looney Tunes cartoons. And any time, as you may know, that a chicken comes on screen or something it will play "Turkey in the Straw," or you know various public domain songs that were relevant to the subject of the moments, so she was reminiscing about home and Pete strikes up a--
cosl0109	Julian: That's really cool.
cosl0110	Clint: "There's No Place Like Home."
cosl0201	Tim: Her um, her character's a little bit inspired by, I think it's "Big Sleep" too, where Bogart is hiding from someone. He needs to hide in a book store.
cosl0202	Peter M: Right.
cosl0203	Tim: And he goes in there, and there's a woman in there and she's really into him.
cosl0204	Peter M: "Do you have a Ben Hur, 1863 edition, the one with the errata on page... 47 or something?"
cosl0205	Tim: Wow, that is a memory you have.
cosl0206	Peter M: Well...
cosl0207	Tim: And it's just really-- He just, he looks at her and he's like, um, she seems like she's really attracted to him, if I remember correctly. And he like takes off her glasses, he's like, "Yeah, okay." It's a really kind of messed up scene.
cosl0208	Peter M: Well, that's-- You know, that was the subtext of the noir film.
cosl0209	Tim: And then he pulled the shade.
cosl0210	Peter M: Hanky panky.
cosl0211	Tim: Yeah, the hanky panky. Yeah they lock the door and pull down the shades. And that's a little bit what this scene is a reference to, or inspired by.
cosl0212	Peter M: 'cause she's telling him her story.
cosl0213	Tim: Mm hm.
cogt0101	Clint: Speaking of database, I mean that was really how we accomplished so much, right? Is from an organizational standpoint of the music, of the sound effects, and of the voice. And I remember, especially for voice, how critical it was. And what we in the sound department would do is inherit and share the use of the database with the voice department, um, and you could do a search and isolate all the lines for, say, Manny, or isolate all the lines that needed to have reverb baked into them, or another type of processing. And then you would just divide and conquer, and just master everything in groups and bring it all together. Have single reference for volume. And uh, use the database to keep organized and isolate different found sets of different criteria.
cots0101	Tim: Strange, the characters in this game don't like to go into crowded areas, almost as if it's too hard to render them.
cobi0101	Bret: There's that spotlight.
cobi0102	Kevin: Mm hm. Yeah, so this was another like-- We lifted up the, er, took the technology from Renderdroid, which was in "Jedi Knight," but it didn't have spotlights at the time. It just had directional lights and point lights. So that was actually one of the very first things when, uh--
cobi0103	Bret: Yeah, that's the first thing you did.
cobi0104	Kevin: Yeah, when I got hired onto the team, which I was brand new to LucasArts, and uh, Tim and Bret brought me in and my first thing I was like, "I'm gonna put in spotlights, 'cause I know how to do that, and it's gonna matter, and uh, that'll be my stake in the ground." And this was one of the first scenes I worked on that had spotlights. So... when Manny walks off stage and you see the light, you know when he walks out of the light... That was a pretty important moment. Everybody thought that was pretty cool. I was like, alright, I did something. I'm in this amazing project with this amazing team and I did something.
cobi0201	Tim: And then, for some reason I was always really interested in beatniks. Beatniks and reds. I think it was so foreign to me, like the "Red Scare" was not part of my actual life, but it always seemed like-- This thing is, it's hard... It was always funny to me to imagine how passionate people were about that. How big of a deal--
cobi0202	Peter M: Oh yeah.
cobi0203	Tim: -- it was for them. And it was always... from a safe distance it was just kind of entertaining. Like, oh wow, people were really concerned about Communists everywhere and unions and...
cobi0204	Peter M: I remember there were--when I was a little kid there were-- people would still talk about Communist plots in all seriousness, yeah.
cobe0101	Paul: Oh and I'm sorry, Gaurav, this is the set that you had to build twice.
cobe0102	Mark: This is Gaurav's, right?
cobe0103	Gaurav: Yeah, this is the one.
cobe0104	Paul: This was the gift that kept on giving.
cobe0105	Dave: And it's actually very beautiful.
cobe0106	Paul: Yes! Well, a second time is...
cobe0107	Gaurav: Too kind. Yeah, the second time...
cobe0108	Paul: But I'm sorry, you were saying that that was a real building.
cobe0109	Gaurav: Yeah, yeah.
cobe0110	Paul: Where? Was that in Spain?
cobe0111	Gaurav: Uh, I think it's in Paris. I think. And I remember seeing a photo of it and being like, "Wait, Peter [Tsaykel]..."
cobe0112	Paul: Uh, nuh... Good artists borrow, great artists steal.
cobw0101	Paul: Oh, we definitely should give a huge shout-out to Peter Chan and-- Yeah, I'm still jealous of that guy.
cobw0102	Dave: "Chan the Man."
cobw0103	Paul: I know. Just when those packages [of concept art] would come it would just be like Christmas, and you'd open... Yeah you'd see those and you just think, "Aw man, and he's a nice guy, too," you know. Happy family--
cobw0104	Dave: The weird thing about that was I never experienced like the delivery of the package first-hand, but I still got excited about it.
cobw0105	Paul: Nah, they were beautiful. And he's such a sweetheart.
coci0101	Dave: I remember animating Manny sliding down the banister. And I remember Tim kept calling for something... "He's gotta look cool!" And so I did that, and I don't think he was ever really happy with it. So I don't know, apparently I don't know what "cool" means.
coci0102	Mark: Gotta put some Ray-Bans on him.
coci0103	Dave: Aw, yeah. I mean he's, Manny's a suave guy but I don't know if suave guys slide down banisters. Maybe I should have done it slower.
coci0201	Tim: You get a special award for playing the "Rusty Anchor" song.
coci0202	Peter M: I secretly wanted to be, to sing this one. I did a demo for you, remember?
coci0203	Tim: Yeah, this is one of the things--much like Cabbage Boy--that we wrote together. I wrote the lyrics and then you came up with a tune and then changed the lyrics a little bit to actually make them more musical... "My boat's got a rusty anchor..."
coci0204	Peter M: Yeah... "Oh, rusty anchor! Going down, down, down." See?
coci0205	Tim: Do it! "Oh, rusty anchor... [Guess I gotta] stink around." I said "stink around." It's "stick around."
coci0301	Tim: I wish you would slide down the banister because we put a lot of effort into sliding that banister.
coci0302	Tim: Come on, slide down the banister. I recommend any player who's in this room slide down the banister. It's much faster than walking.
coci0303	Peter M: Especially if you're six and you don't have terrible consequences when you hit the bottom.
coci0304	Tim: You should not try that at home. Actually, kids, you should. You should go slide down the banister of your house right now.
coci0305	Peter M: Everybody's gotta do it once!
cowc0101	Bret: So this is a-- This is one of the parts of the game where a huge amount was cut out. There was supposed to be a gigantic action sequence, like there was in all of-- You know, I think we cut a giant action sequence out of every year. But there was a gigantic action sequence where there was an animal called the "Dillopede" that guarded the bottom of the elevator. It was a giant armadillo. And the Dillopede was there to, uh, kind of snap at Manny as he came down. There's this whole sequence where you had to kind of, you know... You had the Dillopede hanging by some elevator cable and he was snapping at you, and you had to swing on him or something like that, and... It's just the idea of a giant, vicious armadillo still sticks with me, but it was one of those things where it's like, you look at the context of the game and it's an adventure game and the budget's short. We were already going to be a huge game. What purpose is this serving the game? So we had to cut a lot of stuff out like that, that just was really cool and fun to design but ultimately not critical to the game and was going to be really expensive.
#year3commentary	
cofh0101	Dave: Tim had the coolest office.
cofh0102	Mark: He did.
cofh0103	Dave: It was filled with, like, tiki lights and it felt like, it was like Christmas land. Not Christmasey, but... It gave you that same feeling of decoration and homeyness.
cofh0104	Alex: Yeah. I was going to say warmth. Yeah, homeyness. There was a couch in there which was always nice.
cofh0105	Dave: Yup. And I think I probably overstayed my welcome in there a few times.
cofh0106	Gaurav: I think we all probably did.
cofh0107	Mark: You never knew when you were, when you should leave 'cause it was so much fun in there, but then it's like, oh man, he has work to do.
cofh0108	Dave: Yeah, it's no wonder he had to work through the night. It's because we would--
cofh0109	Alex: We would bother him all the time.
cofh0110	Dave: His office was like going to Disneyland and you'll just sit in there and talk on the couch and just want to be a part of this... uh... this creation.
cofh0111	Alex: He had some old game consoles in there, and I would go and talk classic games with him 'cause he knew that I was an enthusiast as well. So that was fun.
cofh0112	Mark: I think he should have made his office more boring.
cofh0113	Dave: He did spend a lot of time in that office.
cofh0114	Alex: How's his office now?
cofh0115	Dave: I've seen pictures. I think it's pretty cool.
cofh0116	Mark: It's pretty cool. It's like a grown-up version of that office, maybe. He's still got all his Rubik's Cubes on his desk.
cofh0117	Paul: Oh, I forgot about the--
cofh0118	Dave: I forgot he was a master of the Rubik's Cube.
cofh0119	Mark: He is.
cofh0120	Alex: Really?
cofh0121	Mark: Yes. Don't challenge him.
cofh0122	Alex: Well, I would never.
cofo0101	Tim: Mm hm. I always thought it was because they're so cute, I just had to, um, be mean to them. Like once, when my sister got her tonsils taken out, she had big puffy cheeks. I remember my aunt came to visit and she goes, "Oh, you look so cute! I just want to be mean to you!" And I never really understood it until I, we had these little baby angels in the game. I just, "Ooh, I just, wanna just terrorize them!" So you can get out your scythe and scare them and do all these horrible things.
cofo0102	Peter M: It's the Mr. Bill--
cofo0103	Tim: It's a little sick.
cofo0104	Peter M: It's the Mr. Hands in all of us.
cofo0201	Tim: "Angelitos" is actually, um... The little children in the cage, comes from a term that-- It was a popular kind of, um... Well, it was traditional in Mexico to take pictures of your children, even if they died very young. Like, photography of little dead children.
cofo0202	Peter M: It's a old genre, yeah.
cofo0203	Tim: I don't know if that happened in the States, but it was definitely in Mexico.
cofo0204	Peter M: Mexico, yeah. I've seen those. I think you showed them to me, actually.
cofo0205	Tim: And the word they use for children when they-- When they're young, when they died is "angelitos."
cofo0206	Peter M: Oh, yeah.
cofo0207	Tim: It's a dark, dark game.
cofo0208	Peter M: It is dark.
cocy0101	Tim: God, this is where people-- Nowadays it would be like, "Tim, the ideas you have here about this conveyor belt where they can switch directions and rip those chains with a scoop is really complicated, and we could eliminate a lot of work if we just cut this one puzzle." But it's just like, no, we went all the way and we fully implemented exactly what I hoped would happen. The conveyor belt would reverse direction, chain would go up and down, Manny would climb down and against the force of water, bunch up the chain. This is all so complicated. Oh, and you create a little loop. I was like, "This all makes sense in my mind, so the player will be able to figure this out." Like the way that you looped it over that, um, boat. I don't even know if that would work. That's like when you whip a hose to like get it uncaught, when you're watering the plants in the backyard. Your hose gets caught.
cocy0102	Peter M: Right, right, yup. And it did a little whiplash effect, yeah.
cocv0101	Kevin: So one of the things that was super-- Another technical problem that was really interesting was the save/load, 'cause I wanted to cut a bunch of corners on save/load to just make it a little easier to implement. And we had talked about things like you could only save and load, or when you load it would load at the beginning of a room and back up content a little bit. Or just do it where it was a little bit more convenient. And Tim really wanted a really high-fidelity save/load. I remember trying to talk him out of it and he threw the gauntlet down. He was like, "If Manny is in the middle of a line and there's a puff of smoke hanging in the air, then, and I hit save, when he restores he should pick up from the middle of that line where he was at and that puff of smoke should be in the air." And I was like, "Alright, man, if that's what you want that's what you're gonna get." And uh, it was a big pain. It took a lot of work to get it there. But that's the way the game shipped and that's kind of, you know, with controls and things like that, Tim was pretty uncompromising and had a vision of what he wanted this thing to be. And, you know, as much as we were able we gave him what he wanted.
cocu0101	Tim: Now this, all that water was running in the "Rebel Assault" engine. The game is running in the "Jedi Knight" engine, and the, uh--
cocu0102	Peter M: Oh, that's right!
cocu0103	Tim: All the streaming video is from the "Rebel Assault" engine.
cocu0104	Peter M: "... Assault" engine, that is right!"
cocu0105	Tim: So we're compositing the "Rebel Assault" technology on top of "Jedi Knight" technology, and then all the Lua scripting for the gameplay is what comprised the GrimE engine, which we never actually called the GrimE engine at the time but Bret wanted to call it the GrimE engine. It's like, "Grim."
cocu0106	Peter M: Oh, that's funny.
cocu0107	Tim: And later he's been able to do enough interviews where he's called it the GrimE engine, that people just call it the GrimE engine. Now that's fine, it should have a name.
cocu0108	Peter M: Everything should, yeah.
cocu0201	Tim: Those look like my sister's curling iron.
cocu0202	Peter M: I was just going to say, those things always scared me. They're truly terrifying, those--
cocu0203	Tim: The curling iron?
cocu0204	Peter M: Those grinder-- No, the--
cocu0205	Tim: Oh, the grinders.
cocu0206	Peter M: The grinders. The curling irons, to a lesser degree.
cocu0207	Tim: Those are based on my sister's curling iron. No, you don't call them curling irons. Curlers! Based on my sister's curlers.
cocu0208	Peter M: Curlers, right.
cocu0209	Tim: And my terrible fear of curlers.
cocu0210	Peter M: They're fearsome things.
cosu0101	Peter M: The um, the sort of whale sounds in the music are, um, overblowing on the contrabass clarinet.
cosu0102	Tim: Oh yeah. [whale noise]
cosu0103	Peter M: Yeah, Ralph Carney doing his little-- Same thing with the birds that jump up at you and surprise you and squawk.
cosu0201	Tim: So he's been-- This is like a play on moth navigation. Like they say that moths fly into lights 'cause they're used to using the moon for navigation, and they're not used to electric lights. And so he's, um, used to using the moon for navigation but he's been distracted by this thing called The Pearl. And it's made him march in circles all these years.
covd0101	Dave: Are the three stripes on the back of Manny's head, is that hair?
covd0102	Peter T: No, it's just a lazy, lazy design element to match the front of his head.
covd0103	Dave: Oh and the tops of his hands, remember? There's little stripes on there, too.
covd0104	Mark: Day of the Dead decorations, right?
covd0105	Peter T: Yeah.
covd0106	Dave: I never knew what it was, I just thought it was cool.
covd0107	Peter T: It's an Adidas homage.
coew0101	Gaurav: So this whole environment I think was worked on around the end of the game and we had to bring in a few other artists on at the end in order to get it all done.
coew0102	Paul: Yeah. I kind of remember that, towards the end, 'cause it was just like a skeleton crew. The budget had gotten so big that I just remember Pete [Tsaykel] and a few other people working on it for a couple of months or something, while all of us had to move on to other projects.
colu0101	Peter M: So once in a while, if there was a solo part that we could, um, get to be recorded by a real person, we would do that. But um, I don't know if you remember, we were kind of under a lot of schedule pressure with that.
colu0102	Tim: I do remember some--
colu0103	Peter M: And people were like--
colu0104	Tim: One late night or two. There was a late night or two.
colu0105	Peter M: And then there was like, "You're spending thirteen thousand dollars on live musicians!? Are you crazy?" So we were lucky we could do what we could do at all, but...
colu0106	Tim: And look, where are those guys today? I don't even remember their names, and here we are talking about "Grim."
colu0107	Peter M: Exactly.
colu0108	Tim: Those guys are all dead. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I meant I hope they're dead.
colu0109	Tim: I hope they're happy, spending time with their families, and no longer working on games.
colu0110	Tim: Which I think actually is true.
colu0201	Mark: It's hard to make them kiss 'cause they have those--
colu0202	Alex: They don't have lips.
colu0203	Dave: They should've added like a [knock sound], like a knocking sound.
colu0204	Alex: Oh, that would've been funny.
colu0205	Mark: Bones kissing.
colu0206	Dave: Yeah, making out. Imagine what that sounds like with a bony face.
colz0101	Bret: We stole a lot of the really good things out of SCUMM and kept them. We kept the idea of the chore tool, which I just call CHORTLE, but they had CYST and BILE and all these bodily humor-flavored tools from SCUMM. CYST, BILE, FLEM, MMUCUS, and we kept-- But the, there are analogues, like the chore tool is the really big one, but it's the analogue to what they did in CYST which was the costume editor for all the other adventure games. And we kept those paradigms, you know they manipulate 3-D elements and 2-D elements and movies and things together on one timeline, but that really is harkening back to exactly what they were doing in 2-D games.
colz0102	Kevin: Lucas[Arts] is remembered for the great art and the funny writing and all of that, but it's all built on--
colz0103	Bret: Yeah, it's good tech.
colz0104	Kevin: Just amazing tech.
codp0101	Tim: One weird trivia fact about the world that I learned, I was um, I saw a couple of Manny Calavera tattoos when I was at PAX. And someone asked me, "Why are there no Glottis tattoos?" I started Googling and I couldn't find a single Glottis tattoo on the Internet. I found many Manny tattoos. And so I don't know why Glottis-- I'll just say that on the Internet tomorrow.
codp0102	Peter M: That there need to be more Glottis tattoos, I agree with that.
codr0101	Peter M: I was gonna say about the music, where he reveals the whole big conspiracy theory, that was a jam between the cello player and the, um, the contrabass clarinet player.
codr0102	Tim: Oh yeah.
codr0103	Peter M: Basically, the idea was that since it's a whole complicated conspiracy, that they would just jam and jam forever on the same theme, kind of weaving it out.
codr0104	Tim: Mm hm.
codr0201	Tim: You can't hear what he's listening-- What is Domino listening to on his headphones, in your mind?
codr0202	Peter M: Oh, he's li-- It's not just what he's--
codr0203	Tim: You can actually hear like a little--
codr0204	Peter M: He's listening to his own theme, and it's done as a headphone-- We mixed it so it would sound like headphones. It's very quiet, but he's listening to his own music.
coac0101	Dave: One thing that was a little weird animating all this underwater stuff: when you animated a little section like Manny jumping off the conveyor belt, or climbing up a chain, or getting dragged along by a boat or whatever, you would always try to add that element of the physics of being underwater. And then seeing the harsh contrast of when you're back in interactive mode and we're still using the same animation of him walking above water, it was hard for an animator to get over that. These little things you can't let go of.
coac0102	Mark: You would have had to do a whole new set of anims, like...
coac0103	Dave: And that, well, the other thing is we may not have, that may not have been the... The thing that would've stopped something like that. It could've even been, like... There would be too much code required to switch a system or something. Like, who knows what the reason was.
coei0101	Clint: Thinking back to the way that we all worked together at LucasArts. You know, the way the different departments collaborated. You know, it was-- Everybody just assumed that we were all rooting for each other and on the same team, and there was almost no sense of kind of trial period or-- Nowadays, and for a long time now in the video game industry, a lot of times when you are in a service capacity, such as sound or audio/music, uh, there's really a vetting period where what you're presenting is being vetted by the directors and producers and you need to hear back. What did they think? Are they going to want to continue to work with us, and that kind of thing. And that's fine. It's the way the film industry is, that's the way things are. But back then, especially at LucasArts, it was not at all like that. Everyone just wanted to be working together. It was all one team. Everyone was facing in the same collaborative direction and achieving fun results. I think that creates an atmosphere in which people feel comfortable creating and taking risks. So it paid off, I think.
cogh0101	Dave: I remember being really-- See how their hands kind of clip through their sleeves? I remember being really annoyed by that, as an animator. Having to settle to do it 'cause you just, you couldn't get the poses and the lines you needed... uh... without making things kind of collide. It's something we just had to kind of live with.
cogh0102	Peter T: And something we still live with today.
cogh0201	Mark: So that chain that's holding the ship. At one point we had to add joints to that because I think at one point it's animated. And it kept crashing and we couldn't figure out why, and we eventually figured out that you couldn't have more than ninety-nine joints in a rig in Softimage at that point. It had like a hundred joints or something.
cogh0202	Paul: No, but again it's this funny thing when people maybe see this stuff and they think of movies now that maybe look better, but we were having to deal with a lot of limitations.
cogh0203	Dave: I'm actually really, really excited to see the Remastered version because, you know, you look at elements of this game that was made over fifteen years ago and visually it still kind of holds up to games that you can see today. So I'm curious about what it's going to look like after Double Fine gets finished with it. I think it'd be pretty special.
covi0101	Darragh: It's funny, the casting of Manny was... It was tough because... Obviously you have-- I wanted to hire somebody who was legitimately Hispanic, and not somebody putting on a fake accent.
covi0102	Julian: Oh, for sure.
covi0103	Darragh: And normally in sort of the casting process you'd sit down with the project leader. You'd probably have five to ten candidates that you'd be looking at, and with Manny we had two. And Tony was more Humphrey Bogart and the actor was more comedic, and I was terrified that Tim was going to go the comedic route because I thought Tony was the guy. I remember printing out résumés for the two guys and Tony had a lot more experience. Then there was a really cool picture of Tony taken from Havana where he's sitting up at the bar, and he just looked cool. I made sure that went in, too, just to help kind of push it in the direction I wanted it to go.
covi0104	Julian: And it's just, it's the perfect voice.
covi0105	Darragh: Yeah, yeah, he's great.
covo0101	Tim: There was a-- The elevator in my dorm that you could... push open while it was moving. You push the gate open, it freezes it in between floors, and hang out in the elevator for no reason. But there was a little, like a little, like, strip of metal up in the corner that that door would plug into when it was closed to know that it was closed. And we tried to get the elevator moving with the door open by sticking-- We're sticking our fingers in this thing, trying to trigger the little switch. I totally got electrocuted because it was like a live, actual electrical current in there.
covo0102	Peter M: Yeah, ouch!
covo0103	Tim: So that's where that comes from. That little door closing thing.
covo0104	Peter M: From ill-advised college activities?
covo0105	Tim: Ill-advised, drunken college dorm elevator near-death pranks.
cobl0101	Dave: The animation team was very green and we were lucky to work under people like Pete [Tsaykel] and some other senior folks on the team, like Eric Ingerson and Mark Hamer. We came out of school learning traditionally 2-D animation and probably had about a month or two of work on "Monkey Island 3," I think, which was still semi-traditional. And then this was our first kind of interaction with the 3-D and computers and we struggled. We watched Eric do the most complex things you can imagine.
cobl0102	Peter T: It was all very new. I think we had a couple of consulting sessions. This was back when we were still kind of connected to ILM, and so we had Kyle Balda who's a, was a LucasArts alum, and at the time worked at ILM. He came over and gave us some 3-D pointers. At a couple of points we had some special private sessions.
coop0101	Dave: Oh, I wanted to also talk about-- I think this was, this may have been the first game, it may not have, but at LucasArts that I can remember, where you walk the character around and procedurally his head, Manny's head is turning towards--
coop0102	Paul: Oh, right.
coop0103	Dave: -- points of interest.
coop0104	Mark: Yeah.
coop0105	Dave: Procedurally!
coop0106	Mark: It was the first head tracking, right, at LucasArts?
coop0107	Dave: With a computer!
coop0108	Alex: Oh, definitely at LucasArts it was, for sure.
coop0109	Mark: I think that was because Tim didn't want to have like the UI highlighting stuff, right? Or he wanted to try something new.
coop0110	Dave: Yeah, it was partial hint and partial probably red herring, right?
coop0111	Mark: Oh.
coop0112	Dave: Like just show the player that they're in, point them in the direction of interesting subjects in the environment.
coop0113	Alex: And I mean, it shows you everything you can interact with, and not everything you can interact with is a solution, either.
coop0114	Peter T: There's no UI in this game, if anyone didn't notice, and that was by design.
coar0101	Peter M: I love the pulling the stocking down, and the leg bone being sexy. That's awesome.
coar0102	Tim: Our one cover image. Was it like a magazine? PC Games magazine, that image.
coar0103	Peter M: Oh yeah, I remember.
coar0104	Tim: But what is that from? This is definitely a reference to "Popeye."
coar0105	Peter M: And also, "Go ahead and scratch," right?
coar0106	Tim: What's "go ahead and scratch"?
coar0107	Peter M: When Humphrey Bogart, in "Maltese Falcon"--sorry, not "Maltese...", "Big Sleep." Humphrey Bogart is meeting-- Lauren Bacall comes into his office and she sits on his desk, and she crosses her legs, and she's scratching her knee. And the camera is showing you this from a interesting angle, right? Then she sees that he's looking at her scratching her knee and she covers her knee with her dress. He says, "Go ahead and scratch."
coar0108	Tim: "Go ahead and scratch." Um, I was thinking more of "Popeye." Olive Oyl falls into cement and she steps out of cement and everyone's whistling at her 'cause she has shapely legs and the cement falls away and she has Olive Oyl legs.
coar0109	Peter M: Oh I forgot that.
coar0110	Tim: That's what I always think of when I think of this scene.
coar0111	Peter M: There it is.
coar0201	Kevin: Yeah, so people, you know, a lot of people may know this already, but for those that don't: the game is just a big pre-rendered picture. There's no 3-D geometry in the game that describes the walls and the doors and the tables and all the props that are in the game. That's just a picture, a painting that's drawn in the background. So somebody had to go in manually and kind of make what we call walk boxes, but they're in 3-D space. They're like a little model that just describes, in 3-D space, where the, where Manny's allowed to walk. And if you turn the background off they just look like they're floating in space. There's nothing there. And there's boxes for walking, there's boxes for shadows, there's boxes for triggers that trigger, like, footstep sounds and things like that. But yeah, the image you see on the screen when you're playing the game, there is no real geometry there, so getting the illusion that Manny can walk in between tables and bounce off of walls and things like that is all smoke and mirrors.
coar0301	Peter M: See, I like that you still are not quite sure about Meche.
coar0302	Tim: That happens a lot in those noir movies.
coar0303	Peter M: Totally, it's just like--
coar0304	Tim: The woman is like, wait, is she in leagues with the bad guy, or is she being controlled and being blackmailed by the bad guy?
coar0305	Peter M: Yes. A testament to the fact that they're written by men.
coar0306	Tim: Ha ha ha ha ha... nervous laughter.
coil0101	Tim: Oh no, all the sprouted sailors. But what happens to their souls when they're sprouted?
coil0102	Peter M: I was wondering that myself.
coil0103	Tim: I think the idea was that they take the flowers and bring them back to the Land of the Living. They, like, get recycled.
coil0104	Peter M: Ah, they--
coil0105	Tim: I never really thought it through.
coil0106	Peter M: -- they get reincarnated which is sort of what you don't wanna do, if you're [dead].
comn0101	Kevin: One of the things with Manny's head and the look-at stuff was, um, it really meant that you couldn't put a lot of inventory items very close to each other, or limited the number of things in a room because even though you could toggle through and he would look at things kind of in sequence, it could get tricky if you put like three things on a table. Is he looking at thing number one, thing number two, or thing number three? So that was an interesting thing 'cause Lucas[Arts] was known for these adventure games with very dense-- Yeah, lots of things to click on in the screen. And you really couldn't do that here, but the game doesn't really feel lacking for it.
comn0102	Bret: I feel like that's filled in with dialogue. I mean ultimately you'd have those hunt-the-pixel games, you'd have a million things and you'd have to have one line for each thing. And with this one it's more like there are fewer things but there's more to say about each one, or more context or Manny kind of thinking to himself about things. It's a little more ruminating. So I think it adds to the character, just in terms of how much you kind of understand Manny or empathize with him.
comn0201	Lleslle: And do you remember the "Jesus bug?"
comn0202	Clint: No.
comn0203	Lleslle: The one where, when Manny would come on the water and he would float around, all over the screen? And so it would just randomly show up. And that was this bug that could not be squashed, that we think we'd kill and it'd come back. And talking about just trying to get it done, right? We were around the clock, it was towards the end. And literally we were, some of us were sleeping there and Bret Mogilefsky was working around the clock. And finally it was Tim, Steve Dauterman, myself, and then Bret's like, "I gotta go home now. I'm gonna go home now and they're going to test the new build." You know, and I was like, "Okay, go home. Get some sleep." It was like two or three in the morning. And then he just got home, and the "Jesus bug" came back.
comn0204	Clint: Ohh.
comn0205	Lleslle: Yeah! And then we were sitting in Steve Dauterman's office. And then I was on the couch and we were like, "Well, who's gonna call Bret?" And Steve looks at me and he's like, "You're the production manager." And it was like, oh gah!
comn0206	Clint: "Hey Bret, how's it going?"
comn0207	Lleslle: I know. "Hey, hi, can you come back? Thanks!"
comn0301	Tim: Reciprocating chisel... This scene is kind of actually right out of "The Fountainhead," this really-- Um, I think it's, is it Gary Cooper, or um... someone like that. And he's doing this super manly, like, drilling into this wall and the love interest of it comes over and is watching him, getting all aroused in a kind of a nineteen-thirties kind of way. And she's so mad that she's like-- She's out riding her horse and she slaps her riding crop onto her leg, show[s] her frustration. It's this hilarious scene. But for some reason I really like this jackhammer that he's just going into this wall with. And so it's here in a very similar erotic content here between Manny and Chepito.
comn0302	Peter M: Yeah, it's like I can see the... I can see the brotherly love.
cops0101	Dave: I wanted to point out that this octopus that we're seeing underwater was, I think, one of the things that Eric Ingerson took on.
cops0102	Mark: I was gonna say that, yeah.
cops0103	Dave: And it is-- That, back in 1997, that's probably like an animator's worst nightmare right there, I think. Trying to animate all those tentacles and not having a really intricate rig to work and keep all the curves in the arms. I'm not quite sure if Eric animated the tentacles frame-by-frame and bone-by-bone. I think he may have actually spent more time working on a rig to get what he wanted than he did animating.
cops0104	Mark: Yeah, he definitely set that character up, and he worked on that animal. And I think he did the spiders too, weren't we saying?
cops0105	Dave: I think Chris Schultz did some of that.
cops0106	Mark: Oh, Chris Schultz did the spiders.
cops0107	Dave: He may have rigged it, maybe.
cops0108	Mark: But Eric, he was really good at rigging and setting up the really complicated characters so that they would animate well.
cops0109	Dave: I think I remember Chris Schultz having some kind of elation going on when he got the spider rig 'cause he thought it was cool the way it worked.
cops0201	Kevin: You know, Tim's really into black velvet.
cops0202	Bret: Yeah.
cops0203	Kevin: And when I showed up my first day at work, there was a black velvet... kind of canvas, I don't know what it was. It was like this kind of like, you'd win it at the fair kind of thing. And it was like the grim reaper on a motorcycle with Mount Fuji in the background with these eagles flying out of it. And it was just pinned to the wall above my desk on the project. And for the entire project we really didn't talk much about it. It was just kind of there. And then when I moved on to the next project after it, I left my desk exactly the way I had found it, with the thing pinned up to the wall and the whole thing. And then Tim came and gave it to me. I still have it in my office right now. But he was like, "That's the mural that binds together 'Full Throttle' and 'Grim Fandango'--
cops0204	Bret: Interesting.
cops0205	Kevin: "--because it's the grim reaper on a motorcycle."
coea0101	Tim: And this is the part of the game I feel like it a lot more inspired by, actually, "City of Lost Children."
coea0102	Peter M: --"Children," yeah, right.
coea0103	Tim: That came out around that time, had a big influence on us. I think that's why we have a marching underwater diver, too. Like there's a lot of scenes in "City of Lost Children" where there's a diver just marching on the floor of the ocean, and it just seemed so dramatic and just he made this slow and steady pace, like... Slow and steady progress, but he was so heavy, and... and thick.
coea0104	Peter M: No flying fleas, though.
coea0105	Tim: No flying fleas.
cobu0101	Dave: I can't even imagine what was going through [Tim's] head at this point 'cause just the size of this game... Being able to absorb it all before it's realized.
cobu0102	Mark: He always had a really good idea of where we were and what was going on. And we were talking earlier about how there really wasn't a schedule that I remember, an art schedule for this game. It almost seemed like we just all sort of chose tasks and then we had Lleslle [Schroeder] sort of following up to make sure that we were... Doing them in about as much time as they should take, or not getting bogged down or stuck.
#year4commentary	
cosi0401	Dave: I have to say, coming out of school I felt super lucky to first of all be hired by LucasArts, by some colleagues of mine who went to the same school. And to walk into this building and see all the concept art for this game on the walls, I was like a kid in a candy store. It was instant euphoric inspiration. And um, I just felt like the luckiest guy in the world coming out of school, getting to work on a project of this caliber. It was beautiful.
colx0401	Tim: Yeah, the sprouting came later. It was like a solution to a problem we were having narratively with the game, which is like how do you make anything matter in the Land of the Dead? Like if you're going up against mobsters in a movie, usually you're afraid they're going to kill you or someone you love, right? Or break your thumbs. And in the Land of the Dead, who cares, you're dead, right? So we're like, "How do you kill people in the Land of the Dead?" And so we wanted to have it be that you were essentially brought back to life, like it went the other direction. You were returned to flowers. Um, and then flowers become this symbol of death in a weird way in the Land of the Dead. But flowers are such a huge part of the Day of the Dead, like the marigolds that you use in the Day of the Dead celebration, and the smell of marigolds are like a big part of the ceremony, so it was nice to have them be part of the game, too. And then the end of the game we wanted to have this thing called "the meadow," which was just full of flowers, which hopefully by that time would just look like death to you.
colm0201	Peter M: Tim, how come you know so much about neurosis and psychosis? Really...
colm0202	Tim: I don't know if--
colm0203	Peter M: It's quite striking.
colm0204	Tim: I don't know if any of this is legitimate psychological knowledge, or just what I learned from movies.
colm0205	Peter M: Well, speaking as sort of a crazy guy myself, it rings true to me.
cosd0301	Bret: Actually, I think it was funny when you came in and you were all excited about working on this game like, "I really like adventure games! I wanna do this kind of thing, I worked on all my own games." And I think about TellTale and it's like, okay, yeah that's pretty much in keeping. This was a long time ago, but I remember when you came in your game that you had worked on was like a helicopter game...?
cosd0302	Kevin: "Helicops!" Yes.
cosd0303	Bret: And it was like, as far different from this as you could possibly imagine a game would be, and I would not have imagined that a person who worked on "Helicops" was actually interested in adventure games.
cosd0304	Kevin: There weren't any games like this. All I wanted to do was play with little people in computers and I had gotten to the point where I almost ended up working on a baseball game 'cause that was the closest thing I could find to little people in computers. Um, and that's when I saw this. I was just like, it doesn't matter. I have to work on this.
coxb0101	Tim: Someone told me, like, this was the moment [when] they cried in the game. Just hearing how scared Glottis was in this scene, 'cause he gets really frightened. And it's actually a reference to a claim that a babysitter made about me when they were babysitting me. They said, "Oh, gee, you were so scared when your parents-- You would sit there and you'd say, 'Mother, mother, I'm frightened!'" And I was like, "No, okay first of all I never said that. I never said 'mother.'"
coxb0102	Peter M: Yeah, that's suspicious right there.
coxb0103	Tim: But it got to be this family joke. "Mother, I'm frightened! I'm frightened, mother!" And so that line actually got in the game.
cohb0101	Bret: Well I think it's one of the real challenges for adventure games because so many things you make for an adventure game are single use. Like single use animation, single use scenes, single use textures. They're all like, you do a first-person shooter, or you do, you know, adventure ga-- Oh, sorry, like a platformer or something like that. There are so many animations that get re-used so many times throughout the whole game, in an adventure game a huge amount of it is custom throwaway meant to be seen once or twice and occasionally all the time like walk cycles. But, you know it's not like "Mario." You know at the time they were doing "Mario 64" and it's like Mario has, you know, a ridiculous number of animations but it's a finite set and it's like they can all be loaded at all times. In this game, you have to dynamically load all the animations as they're needed, you have to make sure they're available before their triggers so you don't get these glitches while you wait for them. And a lot of them are just, they're thrown away. Every single one has to be individually processed by a human to get them into the game and potentially rigged up. And that's one of the challenges of making adventure games, is that you have all these sort of custom things and you want to reuse them as much as possible but in order to do that you have to automate a lot of stuff. Automate as much processing as you can. But you still have to have that ability to fix things. You know, in film, "We'll fix it in post." It's the same kind of thing. It's like, "We'll fix it in the engine. We'll fix it in the tool." As opposed to, "We'll fix it in the source art."
cohb0102	Kevin: And that's the uh, you know, like, you could walk to any room you want, and like all the little one-off assets? I think that's a unique challenge, technically, to adventure games that a lot of other games... Other genres don't really have to address. We're constantly loading in custom stuff and kicking custom stuff out, and on this game memory is tight. You walk into this room and we need sixteen-bit flipbooks of doors opening and closing, and one-off animations of "you may go and play the piano," "you may not go and play the piano." And there's all this technical kind of tomfoolery going on of trying to get the content that may be, that somebody-- Might be used, might not be used. You might just be running through this room to some other room. And it's not like loading up a level in a first-person shooter where you're like, "Okay, I-- I know what's going to be in front of the user at any one point in time. And we're going to use the same bad guy fifty times, over-- So I just need to get the stuff to run the bad guy in memory." This was a constant dance of like, just in time loading and management of stuff... because, uh... You could walk into this room and spend ten minutes in this room and explore every bit of content that this room could offer you, or you could just be running through on your way to somewhere else.
cohb0103	Bret: Back to this other puzzle.
cohb0104	Kevin: Yep.
cohb0105	Bret: Yeah.
cobk0201	Alex: I remember some trickle-down drama, from upstairs, in the test pit towards the end where things didn't seem to be getting done as fast as... whomever wanted them to be getting done, you know? And I just remember, like, there was some question as to whether or not we'd have to cut a bunch of scenes or even a whole year from the game, or something, because stuff wasn't coming in.
cobk0202	Dave: That was terrifying.
cobk0203	Alex: Yeah.
cobi0301	Darragh: But it was great. I mean, "Grim" is definitely still sort of the most satisfying project I think I've ever worked on. It was, it was just a lot of fun and um... You know, Cuban actors, American actors, Irish actors. A guy from Hungary. You know just all over the place, just--
cobi0302	Julian: Yeah.
cobi0303	Darragh: Bring that sort of diversity to it.
cobw0201	Paul: I think I offended Tim once when I said, "Tim, you should write scripts for movies! This is such a great idea." And Tim said, "I... I make video games. I wanna make video games. Why are you telling me to do something different?" And... I felt bad.
cobw0202	Dave: You cried that time?
cobw0203	Paul: I-- No, I only cry at night. Late at night. But--
cobw0204	Dave: Tim was often at the office at night time. I remember him--
cobw0205	Paul: Oh, yes.
cobw0206	Dave: -- locking his office door, and me trying to peak in between the curtains he laid over top of the glass. And he would be in there for days.
cobw0207	Paul: Wow... Yes.
cobw0208	Dave: When he finally got down to doing the dialogue stuff, I remember that. It was always like a pressure valve that blew on him at one time or another. And he would just lock himself in and... churn out this... amazing dialogue.
cobw0209	Paul: No, I mean I think Tim was a very intimidating person try and-- To try and be funny around Tim was hard 'cause he was so funny, and I never felt like I kind of rose to--
cobw0210	Dave: I relied on my funny Canadianness.
cobw0211	Paul: Right.
cobw0212	Dave: And my looks. That was enough.
cobw0213	Paul: I think it was, yes. Your biting wit.
cobw0214	Dave: I think I bested him one time with a facial expression that was not intentional.
cobw0215	Paul: What was the expression? Can you do it for the people on the commentary?
cobw0216	Dave: You'll see it in the game, if you look hard enough.
cobw0217	Paul: Good Lord!
cobw0218	Alex: Amazing.
cojb0101	Tim: I don't know if people agree with me. That was my idea of-- What do they call something that makes you barf? Something you take.
cojb0102	Peter M: Uh, expectorant?
cojb0103	Tim: No no, not expectorant... Ipecac! Ipecac.
cojb0104	Peter M: Ipecac, that's the syrup.
cojb0105	Tim: Like a verbal ipecac. Manny talks about the stuff they pack canned hams in, 'cause it's always grossed me out. That weird gelatin. Everyone would have a different thing that they'd bring up that would make them barf.
cojb0106	Peter M: Right, right.
cojb0107	Tim: What's yours?
cojb0108	Peter M: Ipecac is... ipecac. Sounds like that you do when you eat it.
cojb0109	Tim: You ipecac. I don't know how players are supposed to figure out this puzzle. That you had to fill the floor with regurgitated gelatin. It's not the first thing that jumps into people's minds. Where the hell you'd get that--
cojb0110	Peter M: I forgot that--
cojb0111	Tim: -- liquid nitrogen?
cojb0112	Peter M: I thought there was, I forgot that there was a regurgitated gelatin puzzle in the game. That's a standard thing, right?
cojb0113	Tim: Mm hm.
cojb0201	Darragh: Yeah, this is Alan Blumenfeld, who really brought a lot of heart to Glottis.
cojb0202	Julian: Yeah, totally.
cojb0203	Darragh: He's just a... a real sweetheart.
cojb0204	Lleslle: Oh yeah.
coth0101	Dave: One of the cool things about this game, too, is that there's a few characters that actually went through costume changes throughout the... the game, which was a nice detail.
coth0102	Paul: No, and it really gives you a sense of time, uh, time passing.
coth0201	Kevin: You know, this was a real boundary-pushing, from an adventure game genre point of view. And I was making the joke earlier that it's like if everyone isn't claiming that you're ruining adventure games, you're not making adventure an adventure game because...
coth0202	Bret: The grand heritage has to be insulted by every new-- Every new thing you do in adventure games has to be an insult to all adventure games before it. "How dare you innovate!"
coth0203	Kevin: But like, the controls on this one were-- Oh, so controversial. The controls were terrible and we're killing adventure games.
coth0204	Bret: "How dare you take away my mouse cursor!"
coth0205	Kevin: But the new special edition has point-and-click--
coth0206	Bret: I just found that out today.
coth0207	Kevin: You can play it as was imagined, the boundary-pushing experiment, or you can--
coth0208	Bret: They have erased all our innovation!
coth0209	Kevin: Or you can play it the right way.
coth0210	Bret: Thank God our innovation has been undone.
coth0211	Kevin: Yes. We don't need that crap anymore.
coth0301	Tim: There is no-- This is a really boring fact, I'm going to share it anyway. There is no inventory combinations in "Grim Fandango." You can't use an object with another object in your inventory.
coth0302	Peter M: Oh, that's right.
coth0303	Tim: So if you wanna put the bone in the bone grinder, you have to put them in this receptacle in the room. Another weird mechanical contrivance from my own head: a handheld snow grinder that would plug into a giant snow grinder. I'm sure they have those, right?
coth0304	Peter M: What's a snow grinder?
coth0305	Tim: It's like a fake, like, to make fake snow for the show. And this is what I was talking about, you can't use the hand with the snow grinder.
coth0306	Tim: So you put the snow grinder down, then put the hand in it, and then pick it up. And that's how you combine, that's the one object combination puzzle we have.
coth0307	Tim: I don't know why the lid on it closes. That was like really important, technically.
coly0101	Lleslle: Clint, I wanna bounce off like what you're saying before about the passion that everybody had, because it is. I remember us all just-- It was no big deal to stay the night sometimes, especially towards the end 'cause we were all just trying to fix whatever bugs there were, and just make it better and polished. And I remember some of the conversations that you and I would have about just organization and making sure that, you know, the creative process was supported and all of that. And it just was nice that we all cared about our areas so much, you know?
coly0102	Clint: Absolutely, Lleslle. I think that's really what I was trying to say earlier, is that the goals that everyone set were so high and then they became internalized as the bare minimum. So even though they were beyond necessarily the call of duty, if you will, they were still viewed as must-achieves.
coly0103	Lleslle: Oh yeah, and I think that's like a given on a Tim game thought, right, because his creative, like, bar is so extremely high. And you see him working so much that you just can't-- You can't help it. And especially when you see the game and the story that you're working on, and you want to make sure it's the best. And you can-- Every little nuance, I mean just the music, and like you said, the attention to detail. Just those birds flapping... You know, it's just amazing.
coly0201	Tim: This game was so long and complex, and it had new characters in like the last act and stuff--
coly0202	Peter M: Right.
coly0203	Tim: I was like, "How do we make so much complexity in three years?" I know it sounds like a long time to people who don't-- A lot of it was that it was double-- It was six years because we also worked all night for three years.
coly0204	Peter M: Right, that's true.
coly0205	Tim: We worked all day and all night for three years--
coly0206	Peter M: That is true.
coly0207	Tim: It's like a six year project. And for the good of the games industry we try not to do that anymore. People thought, when the game was going late, like it took longer than-- It was supposed to take like a year, not like three years.
coly0208	Peter M: Yes.
coly0209	Tim: And people wanted to do it episodically. They're like, "Let's just release it episodically." But... who knows what would happen if we had done that. It might not have made act two... or act three.
coly0210	Peter M: Mm hm.
coly0211	Tim: ... 'cause the way things were changing at the company.
coly0301	Tim: I think he's doing Army. I think that's his deal. He's doing, like, soldier boy--
coly0302	Peter M: Right, yeah, no, I get it. It's like Gomer Pyle, yeah.
coly0303	Tim: Kind of. Kind of like Gomer-- Not Gomer! No, he's doing, um--
coly0304	Peter M: Well, I mean, not Gomer specifically himself. But that sort of world of humor.
coly0305	Tim: Mm hm, mm hm.
coly0306	Peter M: Like um... T. Boone Pickens. No, not T. Boone Pickens, but T.--
coly0307	Tim: T. Bone?
coly0308	Peter M: T. Bone Pickens.
coly0309	Tim: That's like, that's someone who will just--
coly0310	Peter M: Slim Pickens! There we go.
coly0311	Tim: Exactly!
coly0312	Peter M: Like Slim Pickens in, um, "Dr. Strangelove."
coly0401	Tim: I relied on Tony Plana to improvise a lot of Spanish, 'cause I didn't write any of the Spanish in the dialogue. I'd write "buddy." It was always like, "Buddy! Hey, buddy! What's going on, buddy?"
coly0402	Peter M: And you would say, "Eh jefe," or something like that.
coly0403	Tim: Yeah. He would say, um, "carnal," which is like... "Carnal" is like really close, like--
coly0404	Peter M: Like carnal, like a blood brother.
coly0405	Tim: Yeah, blood brother. And then it's like, um... I think he calls him "hermano," like "brother" in a few places. And also the "hijole!" And then there's a really bad word for "goat," which he's like, "Oh, in Cuba"--he's a Cuban actor--and he's like, "That's not that bad in Cuban. In Mexico that's a swear word." But I mean here-- So there's some, there's some Spanish in here that might be, um, not for children.
coly0406	Peter M: Need a rating?
coly0407	Tim: Yeah, need a rating--only in Spanish.
cozw0101	Julian: You know, but hearing all these names, too, I just feel like a lot of times I'll catch myself saying, "I went there," instead of, "I worked there," because it was really like being-- It was an extension of college and it was just everyone. We were all friendly, we all hung out together, so whether we were hanging out at work or at someone's house, I mean it was just all a blur, you know?
cozw0102	Lleslle: That's funny, I went... "I went to LucasArts."
cozw0103	Julian: Yeah. Lucas High.
cozw0201	Tim: I think something that helped make this game--one of the secrets to it--was just watching a lot of old movies. Like a lot of this-- It's like some of them are references, but a lot of them are like, um, plot elements, ideas of relationships between people is the subtle stuff that came out of watching old black and white movies, 'cause they just did stuff so differently then, and every... I mean, I know there were formula movies back then but they're not the current formulas, you know, and they're not as pat as the movies you'd watch today. They're surprising, like old film noir movies had relationships between people that feel really different than modern relationships. Some of them are messed up and based on old social things, and some of them are just like, cooler? It's weird.
cozw0202	Peter M: Well, there's a certain stoicism that you don't... You don't...
cozw0203	Tim: And a certain--
cozw0204	Peter M: A kind of reserve, maybe, you don't see in characters now.
cozw0205	Tim: And a little bit of an honesty in characters, like nowadays you don't... I think the way that people talk now, there's like, there's different layers of meaning to everything, and different subtexts--
cozw0206	Peter M: Say "everything's cool," which means, you know... Which means, "eff you," you know, which means that... No, it's more like things were...
cozw0207	Tim: Even though they're old, they're very refreshing, is what I'm saying. Like "Casablanca" has a lot of just honest-- People talking honestly to each other in a way that's different than a modern movie.
cofi0101	Kevin: So yeah, one of the things that I think people don't realize is it's not just pre-rendered art, but there's pre-rendered z-buffers--
cofi0102	Bret: That's right.
cofi0103	Kevin: -- through the whole thing. And we thought that the pre-rendered z-buffers would just do all the work for us, and it turned out that--if you look through the game data--the pre-rendered z-buffers, there's a lot of hand=painted pre-rendered z-buffers. We made a z-buffer editing tool which was funky because you-- It's 16-bit data, and you can't edit 16-bit data in a 8-bit monitor, so...
cofi0104	Bret: It was grayscale. It looks like a ghost scene. It's like you look into like a foggy version of the world.
cofi0105	Kevin: Yeah, so we did like a quantized 8-bit version of it and you could paint into it. People would just use like big boxes and find places where he was clipping, or we didn't want him to clip. A lot of it was we wanted-- He was slightly behind something and he shouldn't have been, so he would like go into the edge of the sofa or something and you just black it out.
cofi0106	Bret: Just black it out, yeah.
cofi0107	Kevin: So that he would pop in front of it.
cofi0108	Bret: Yep.
cofi0201	Darragh: There's a character who shows up later on called The Florist, who is played by a great actor called Keith Szarabajka, who I've worked with a lot over the years and... Keith... Oftentimes, when he auditions the characters-- The way he does his auditions, it's not, they're not usually safe choices that he makes. And the first time I came across him was-- He was auditioning for Boston Low ["The Dig"] and he just... You know, Boston Low is a space commander, and Keith was doing something very... deep and dark and strange, and because his last name is Szarabajka, it just sort of stuck in my head and I used to always look forward to whatever audition Keith was gonna throw our way, and they were always bizarre and never appropriate. And then when he auditioned for The Florist, who's insane because he-- In the real world he's a florist and he deals with flowers, which are beautiful things, but in the "Grim Fandango" world it's death. He's gone crazy. And um... he's deranged. And Keith just nailed the part and was just brilliant and it was at the moment that I realized, oh, he's actually a normal dude and he can do all sorts of other things but just his audition choices are, you know are different and unusual.
cofi0301	Peter M: Yeah we used the sarangi, um, it's the Indian cello--
cofi0302	Tim: Oh, awesome.
cofi0303	Peter M: -- to sort of make a reference to the hippies, I guess you'd say.
cofi0304	Tim: Who was the... the guy with The Beatles?
cofi0305	Peter M: Uh, George Harrison--
cofi0306	Tim: No, the-- The guru they hung out with.
cofi0307	Peter M: Oh, the guru. The Maharishi, yeah. And also, um... Ravi Shankar was sort of a... friend of theirs. He was like a friend of theirs.
cofp0101	Tim: I really didn't like early 3-D, like nineties 3-D 'cause I always though it looked like cardboard boxes that were taped together and that someone had dragged nylons over, you know? And that implies a lot more smooth skinning than actually existed. It was really like-- And then everything was painted on the outside, even things that should be modeled as an interior space, like ribs on a skeleton or something. Everything was painted on the outside, and it looked ridiculous.
cofp0102	Peter M: So it looked like everybody was wearing a Halloween costume anyway.
cofp0103	Tim: Yeah! And then I saw those papier-mâché skeletons where they painted the ribs on the outside and I was like, "This is perfect. This kind of folk art would actually look really good in 3-D." There was a lot of pressure to get into 3-D back then 'cause it was seen as the future. I mean obviously it was 'cause a lot of, um, everything turned into 3-D, but 2-D is still a big money-making thing in games, too.
comy0101	Clint: You know, Lleslle, I remember how you worked to keep everyone together and to help the team snuff out bugs and get this thing finished up, and I have to confess something after all these years that as we would observe bugs in the game, that translated merely to us as, "Okay, fellas, we have more time. Let's get back to work. Let's make this stuff even better." And so we'd see someone's head float off their body and just exit the screen while their body continued to remain on screen, and we'd say, "That's at least another month."
comy0102	Lleslle: So that's how you got more time.
comy0103	Clint: We knew what the schedule was by just simply playing the game.
comy0201	Peter M: You can hear your brother's charango in this, yeah.
comy0202	Tim: Really?
comy0203	Peter M: Yeah, it's-- Well, it was a second ago. I think I heard it.
comy0204	Tim: Hm.
comy0205	Peter M: It's somewhere in the Mayan train station music.
comk0201	Paul: There was somebody that will remain nameless, but uh, I remember that they said--'cause they'd come out of advertising--and they said, "Well, there's three types of animation. There are dogs and cats who chase each other, there are dogs and cats that talk to each other, and then there are logos that spin around. Those are the three types of animation."
comk0202	Dave: That made one potentially amazing animator quit--
comk0203	Paul: Yes, and come to Pixar.
comk0204	Dave: That ended up being a suit at Pixar. So you can do your own homework to find out who that was.
conq0101	Dave: I imagined these pigeons being all over the game, everywhere! And they just showed up in a couple places, and it made me sad.
conq0102	Alex: I think I wrote up a crappy bug about that, and I said, "We want more pigeons!"
conq0103	Dave: Thank you, man!
conq0104	Alex: "Closed."
conq0105	Peter T: I think we ran into the polygon limit and we could only have so many. The pigeons--
conq0106	Dave: Were alpha flats. There were many, many alpha flats.
conq0107	Peter T: Yeah, but there were a lot of them, and they were actually some of the highest poly things in the game, so...
conq0108	Dave: It's my fault.
conq0109	Peter T: 'cause I think every bone got built on the pigeons.
conq0110	Dave: They were actually really fun to animate.
conq0111	Peter T: Yeah, the pigeons were a real fiasco. Sorry, Alex.
conq0112	Dave: It's kind of hard-- It was my first experience--
conq0113	Alex: I appreciate-- This finally brings come closure to the pigeon situation.
conq0114	Peter T: I'm answering your bug right now.
conq0115	Mark: Let's close this bug out.
conq0116	Dave: That was also my first experience animating something and not knowing how it was going to be used, so that was kind of like a different mental shift for me... Um... And it was just the first time I had had to make a bunch of idles, and loops or, you know, take-offs and lands that all had to work together. It was pretty interesting. I remember swearing.
conq0201	Darragh: I remember one day Tony [Plana] came into the studio and he had a silk shirt on and on top of the silk shirt he had a sort of a little sweater... a sleeveless sweater. And we were recording, it was like, "Gah, what are we hearing? What are we hearing?" And the engineer's like, "Oh, I think it's his sweater." We're like, "Hey, Tony, can you take your sweater off?" Takes his sweater off, back to rolling again. Sound's still there. So the-- He took his sweater off, and went back to rolling. It turned out it was his shirt that was making the noise, and we're like, "Tony, it's the shirt! It's the silk shirt." And so he's like, "It's okay, I got a T-shirt on underneath." So he was down--
conq0202	Julian: Just stripping down!
conq0203	Darragh: -- down, yeah, he was stripping down into his T-shirt, and did the rest of the session in his T-shirt. But that was the thing with Tony, is he just loved-- You know, he loved working. For part of the production he was shooting at night on a movie, and there were a couple of days where he came in and he only had like a couple of hours, you know a few hours of sleep. And I remember saying, like, "I can reschedule the session." And he's like, "No no no, let's do it, let's do it." And he always was there to give it-- Yeah, giving it his all.
conq0301	Tim: One of the standard things that happens in noir is that a guy meets a woman that just spirals him into a world of shadows and intrigue and stuff like that. And sometimes it's because it's a femme fatale who's up to no good, and sometimes it's also a totally innocent woman who just happens to be on this path that she's-- She's in sort of trouble and he gets pulled into it. So you meet Meche in this world and it spins Manny off into this whole different path, but it's really-- For some reason it was important to me that Manny was actually partially to blame, or feel like he was partially to blame. Like he thought he had caused her to be lost, when it was actually Domino's fault that she was sent off. He stole her Number Nine Ticket.
conq0302	Peter M: Well, you didn't want to blame the woman, like say "Double Indemnity" does, or--
conq0303	Tim: Yeah, where she was actually scheming and where-- Yeah, this is more someone who Manny feels like he has caused misfortune to come to.
conq0304	Peter M: Or "Maltese Falcon" does for that matter, yeah.
conq0401	Tim: I haven't done it in too many games, but having a year transition between things and changing the location and letting you pick up friends and travel, like, just allows you to have so much character development where Manny and Glottis have now been through a lot of stuff together and they've done... They're in different clothes, which is-- They're in different jobs and they move from town to town together and just, it starts to build this real friendship between them, which is... nice, and I think I realize I'm going to put four year transitions in all games from now on, just so we can have that kind of relationship building.
conq0501	Lleslle: Yeah, I remember having to get extensions. That was like my favorite--
conq0502	Julian: Oh yeah.
conq0503	Lleslle: No, I would have to go in 'cause I'd be the same thing, because I always advocate for the artist, and I did. I mean, that's why I loved working with Tim. He's so creative. And so we would talk and collaborate, and then when I'm like, "No, look, this is the date," 'cause I'm trying to save the date, and he did the ship story. And so then we had to go get more time, and I was like, "Well, how are we going to do that?" And then he was like, "Here's my technique. I go into Jack's office and I stay in there and I threaten to light myself on fire, and I just scream and I stay in there until he extends the date." And I'm like, "That's a great... strategy."
conq0504	Julian: It worked.
conq0505	Lleslle: I know! Threaten to light myself on fire--
conq0506	Clint: Well, see we would never try that in the sound department because Jack would just say, "Go ahead."
conq0507	Julian: Yeah, yeah!
come0101	Paul: Well I think it's neat, too, that we've just... with Tim's storytelling, we come to see flowers as a bad thing, and to see an actual meadow full of flowers. It makes something that would be pretty, uh, ominous.
come0102	Alex: It's grotesque, yes.
come0103	Mark: It's a mass grave.
come0104	Dave: That's crazy. That's a lot of flowers. That's a lot of polygons right there.
come0105	Paul: So, yeah, those are individual flowers in the foreground and then, in the background that they were-- Pardon me, textures.
come0106	Dave: And Paul didn't copy and paste any of them. He built each one.
come0107	Paul: I grew them digitally. I put water on my--
come0108	Dave: He built them really small, and then I had to animate and scale each one of them up to the proper size.
come0201	Tim: I programmed a whole thing here that accurately figured out which window you're aiming at in the greenhouse, like based on your angle of rotation and stuff. It's totally not even for a puzzle, you don't even... I don't know how I figured out which level of... I guess how close you are to the greenhouse.
come0202	Tim: We remember the stuff we worked on the most, and figuring out which window to smash when you're shooting was my little touch here... all for nothing... 'cause you don't even shoot him in there.
come0301	Tim: Oh, I think I thought of the scary thing that ends in a greenhouse. It's, um, "Frosty the Snowman."
come0302	Peter M: Fro... [trails off into laughter]
come0303	Tim: Remember "Frosty the Snowman," they travel with a snowman and then she needs to stay warm so he brings her--she's going to freeze to death--so he brings her into a greenhouse, but then the bad magician locks them inside the greenhouse, and so he melts--
come0304	Peter M: Oh, so it's like a version of "Frozen."
come0305	Tim: -- and I almost cry every time.
come0306	Peter M: Ohh.
come0307	Tim: And then Santa comes and reminds you that it's magic snow, Christmas snow that he's made out of.
come0308	Peter M: Oh my goodness, I missed out on that.
come0309	Tim: So this is obviously a reference to "Frosty the Snowman."
come0310	Peter M: Yeah, that's a famous noir for sure.
come0311	Tim: Mm hm, one of the-- I mean, modern noir.
come0312	Peter M: Yeah.
come0313	Tim: Its themes are subtle.
come0401	Tim: I love how the audio here tells the story of the deadly chemicals moving up the pipes, and...
come0402	Peter M: So he kind of kills him from a distance. It's like the end of, uh... "Big Sleep."
come0403	Tim: I forgot that.
come0404	Peter M: Yeah. Shoots him from behind a car.
cohf0101	Tim: I do remember--during "Full Throttle"--you saying, "You know what we never made here is just a real, like, swing era, crime, film noir story." And it always kind of stuck with me 'cause I was like, "Yeah, we never have done one of those. We should do one because..." I don't know what started us-- A lot of us at the company were starting to get into film noir. I don't know if it was because there was a film festival at the Lark Theater, where they showed every single great noir film, and we went to that. Or if it was... just we were at that age where you start reading Raymond Chandler. We talked about Raymond Chandler a lot in the office, too. You were like, "She was so cold, a lump of spumoni wouldn't melt on her shoulder--"
cohf0102	Peter M: "Slice of spumoni wouldn't have melted on her shoulder," yeah.
cohf0103	Tim: Always stuck with me. I was like, "Man I gotta read more Raymond Chandler." So that started me on that.
cohf0104	Peter M: He's awesome. Yeah and during, it was either "Day of the Tentacle" or "Full Throttle," I wrote a little gangster theme just 'cause I thought it would be cool. It just popped into my head and I wanted to put the melody down, and that might have prompted that comment about it'd be cool if we did a noir thing someday.
cohf0201	Tim: I'm glad I put that in there. I didn't even know that happened. Manny actually got to do some salesmanship. Manny actually got to be a travel agent in the game. I've totally forgotten that.
cohf0202	Tim: Genius! Whoever made this is a genius.
cohf0203	Tim: That's what this commentary is all about. Just me watching things and being like, "Ah, dang. Good job."
cohf0204	Peter M: Yeah. Nice going, nice going.
conl0101	Bret: All we had to do was extract the text lines and just do what they'd always done for all the SCUMM games. But um, I had a brother who was a screenwriter in Hollywood, and he had all these special tools to format his scripts, you know as a screenplay. And I was like, "You know, it'd be really cool if I gave Darragh something he could bring into those guys who were really familiar with screenplays. He could bring them something that looked like a screenplay." So when I wrote the dialogue extraction I made it, um actually format it like a script, and actually did the character swing back and forth. And I gave Tim a way that he could indicate, in comments in the code-- If you format the comments a certain way, like you know, "she pouts," or, "huffily," or some other kind of cue, I would extract that and put it along with it. So just like in a normal screenplay you'd have like, you know, here's my line, "haughty" or whatever, you'd have some cue to the actor about how it's supposed to be read. And I even put in scene markers, like this is in the High Roller Casino, or this is exterior docks, so they had a context for where it was in the game. And uh, through the magic of HTML--the web was new--I was able to just spit out HTML, so that's what I did. I wrote a-- I made a screenplay-looking thing in HTML and then they were able to print out and take it down there.
cote0101	Kevin: I remember the, um, the big wall of concept art. There was like--
cote0102	Bret: Yeah, Chan art.
cote0103	Kevin: And fifteen feet tall. And you'll see on the Internet--probably see some of it on the special edition--of these pencil drawings that are-- And you really, you only get to see them one at a time, but they were hundreds of them, and they were all pinned up to this giant cork board.
cote0104	Bret: Yeah, it's like wallpaper.
cote0105	Kevin: They were like wallpaper, yeah. And it was amazing to see this beautiful art transform from these pencil drawings on the wall into the game in front of you.
cote0106	Bret: They kept the style in a lot of cases, I mean some of the things in the 3-D scenes were amazing.
cote0107	Kevin: Yeah, the faithfulness to those original Peter Chan drawings is incredible.
colw0101	Paul: Oh my God.
colw0102	Mark: Look at that.
colw0103	Paul: I forgot about this set.
colw0104	Mark: That looks like a painting or something, it's great.
colw0105	Paul: Yeah it, uh, this was one of the-- Yeah when you get a Peter Chan drawing, this one was a widow maker as well where you just thought, "How does that pipe go in that?"
colw0106	Gaurav: Things didn't quite line up.
colw0107	Dave: You know, I was gonna say that environment with the pipes in it, it almost had like a... a "Day of the Tentacle" or "Sam and Max" feel to it. You know, there's a lot distortion in the pipes and felt a little more wacky than what we see in the rest of the environments.
colw0108	Paul: No, definitely.
cosh0101	Darragh: I didn't put in too many late nights, but there was one where I was in the office at two in the morning, just making notes on the script, and all of a sudden Chuck Jordan walks by my office and says, "Hi!" And there was a way about him that-- Ten minutes later I got up from my desk. I went over to his office and went in and said, "Did you just get in?" And he's like, "Yeah. I get in at two." "Two in the morning?" He's like, "Yeah." And I guess that he'd put in so many late nights that his whole time clock had shifted and so he'd said to Tim, he said, "Hey is it okay if I just come in at two in the morning?" And Tim was like, "Sure!"
cosh0201	Tim: I really like puzzles where you use things backwards. Like you use the-- Instead of finding and using a metal detector to find something metal, you use something metal to find a metal detector in the kitty litter puzzle. And then here you're... Instead of, um... Sprouting, shooting sproutella into bones, you're using bone flakes to um... Expose a sproutella chain. I love this room! It looks almost exactly like the concept art. It looks so painted.
cosh0202	Peter M: Or to open a door you lock it.
cosh0203	Tim: Mm hm. Maybe that's just the formula for all the puzzles. You do something backwards.
cotg0101	Tim: One of the core things about adventure games we'd think about a lot was, what is keeping the player going forward? What is the reward? Because, you know, in RPG games you kill somebody, you get loot, you get items and stuff like that. Or you get rank, you know? So what is the reward for, um... playing adventure games? And it's environments, really.
cotg0102	Peter M: Yes, discovering a new place.
cotg0103	Tim: It's unlocking the new environment. I mean sometimes a cutscene and stuff, but really it's... environments and finding new places.
cotg0201	Peter M: The guy who played the, um, played these Peruvian flutes I believe is from Peru. Have to look at the credits again. He lives in the Mission. It's like the whole "Grim" score lives in the Mission.
cotg0301	Tim: And it's also spiritual in the way that it feels-- That's how you feel like, you feel like this is the end of the game. Because when you get to the part in the story where people are in the clouds, or in the heavens, and you start to hear the pan flute music you know you're kind of near the end of the story, somehow. But then you go back! And there's a whole other year, which creates a feeling of the game being super long. Like I'm playing "Mario" right now and there's a, like more and more levels-- After the end of the story there's more and more, which makes it feel really long, but if you just-- Like it ends at level five, and there's two more levels, but if you like had seven levels people wouldn't appreciate it. But if you end it at five, and then you have, "Oh oh, there's more levels!" It feels really long.
cotg0302	Peter M: It's like the, it's the encore effect.
cotg0303	Tim: Mm hm.
cobs0101	Dave: Alex, you had mentioned on our break that you were the master of playing through this game the most quickly.
cobs0102	Alex: That's right.
cobs0103	Dave: I think you should talk about that 'cause this-- When I played this game, I think it took me a couple of days.
cobs0104	Alex: Yeah. I think, I mean, I'm interested in playing the Remastered version to see how long it takes me. I think it'll be, you know, twelve hours or more. But when we were in test, obviously we were playing it every single day. We knew it inside and out. But when a brand new build came down we always had to play through from beginning to end, and I was the person that always ended up doing that 'cause I could do it the fastest. And I got down to just a little over an hour playthrough time. I wanna say like an hour and ten minutes was my fastest time. Yeah, it was um, it was something else, and I knew this--the whole game--like instinctually, and now I barely remember any of it.
cobs0105	Dave: You must have been able to skip through cutscenes or something--
cobs0106	Alex: Oh yeah, you can. And you can skip dialogue, too.
cobs0107	Dave: I think the cutscene tape that we received so we could watch them, I wanna say was almost two hours long.
cobs0108	Mark: It was like an hour and forty-five minutes, or something.
cobs0109	Paul: Good Lord.
cobs0110	Alex: I'd like to watch that. I mean, I guess we're watching it right now.
comt0101	Tim: I remember what you said once about playing I think it was the Day of the Dead theme... And you got the band to play that. And then you asked them like, "Hey, guys, would you, uh, is this something you might play? Like in your own band?" And they said, "Maybe on Halloween."
comt0102	Peter M: Yeah, that's right.
comt0103	Tim: Which I never-- It doesn't sound like a Halloween piece of music to me, but I guess they were just saying it was freaky.
comt0104	Peter M: Yeah.
comt0105	Tim: Or unusual.
comt0201	Tim: Now that's the ash tray that is-- The very first shot of the game and the very last shot of the game are the same, just like in "Sugarland Express." The shot of the little figurines around that ash tray is the same as the band that stands around this fountain later. That's how you prove that you took at least one film school class in college. You make the first shot the same as the last shot. Basic stuff.
cotd0101	Julian: It's funny 'cause Pete [McConnell] was always great at knowing-- Not only would he know it was gonna slip, he would always say, "Nah, nah..." And then he'd spew out a date. And he was always within weeks, you know. He always-- And sometimes that date was way past where we were being told the date was. In fact, it always was. But he was always right. And I don't know if it was just a sixth sense or if it was, um...
cotd0102	Clint: Well, I--
cotd0103	Julian: -- him putting it together.
cotd0104	Clint: I remember specifically what you're talking about. I'm not gonna be completely correct, but early, early in the year I predicted that it would be June, which was about two months past our deadline. And I felt very bold doing that.
cotd0105	Julian: Yeah, totally!
cotd0106	Clint: But I felt pretty-- On solid ground doing that. Of course this was internal, just within the sound group. We never would--
cotd0107	Julian: We never would say that to you.
cotd0108	Clint: -- share this with other people. And Pete immediately fired back: "Day of the Dead." We all said, "What?" "Day of the Dead." What is that, November fourth?
cotd0109	Lleslle: Um yeah, like fourth or fifth. November fifth.
cotd0110	Clint: And so, you know what, he was within-- We'd have to look at Wikipedia. Do you remember the release date? I don't--
cotd0111	Lleslle: Oh, it was October twenty... Oh man it's--
cotd0112	Julian: Close enough.
cotd0113	Lleslle: It was October.
cotd0114	Clint: Within a couple of weeks. He was within a couple of weeks and that was about March, that he did that.
cotd0115	Lleslle: Oh wow.
cotd0116	Clint: And it's quite amazing that he was able to see that distance. I don't know how he did it, but he said it with conviction, too, that's the funniest thing of all. And he ended up being right.
cotd0201	Tim: I love those cars. You don't even get to see them in the game much, but there's some neat concept art of them. They have pipes coming out the side of them, which is weird. It's like Glottis fixed them up. I think they're based on some actual snow cat combined with a--
cotd0202	Peter M: Oh yeah.
cotd0203	Tim: -- panel truck.
cotd0204	Tim: That's-- 'cause like we have, we'd have this list of things that are gonna be in the game, and nothing was just like, "A truck, make a truck." It was like, "No, let's get Peter Chan to design what a cool snow cat truck would look like in the thirties, but also kind of Mayan in a weird way."
cotd0205	Peter M: Yeah, it is kind of Mayan. That's funny.
cotd0206	Tim: Like everything will get designed.
coat0101	Peter M: There was a certain amount of improvisation that-- The more towards the end of the game you got, the more the musicians improvise. And so--
coat0102	Tim: Yeah, this sounds like the meadow, kind of, isn't it?
coat0103	Peter M: It is. It's a little bit like-- In fact, I think it's a remix of some of the tracks I used in the meadow. And they're sort of riffing on the Hector theme.
coat0104	Tim: Wait, how are they... Where is the Hector theme in this?
coat0105	Peter M: Um, the [sings music] is part of, um...
coat0106	Tim: [sings music] Oh my God! You are ripping this whole game wide open with this Hector conspiracy.
coat0107	Peter M: Kind of, yeah... What I do is hum the Hector theme to them before they would start jamming.
#creditscommentary	
cocr0101	Tim: Are we going to have commentary over the credits? This is where you, uh-- They do it on movies. This is where we see names and we're like, "Oh yeah, that guy was cool!"
cocr0102	Peter M: Yeah yeah yeah.
cocr0103	Tim: "Oh I forgot about her. She's cool." And then, "That Tim Schafer's a dirk--jerk." One of those guys is a jerk. I'm not gonna say who. Adam Schnitzer, I forgot to mention Adam Schnitzer. He did that room where you fill the coffins up with the materials. He was awesome. Sara Simon did textures along with Japeth. Jillian Moffett... C. Andrew Nelson, that's right. C. Andrew Nelson was one of the official Darth Vader appearance persons.
cocr0104	Peter M: Jeff did the mixing.
cocr0105	Tim: He was so tall that he could actually wear the costume.
cocr0106	Peter M: Hans Christian was the, uh, cello player.
cocr0107	Tim: There's a guy named Hans Christian?
cocr0108	Peter M: Hans Christian Reumschuessel, actually is his full name, but he just goes by Hans Christian.
cocr0109	Tim: Charango provided by Martin Schafer.
cocr0110	Peter M: Yeah.
cocr0201	Tim: Senior voice editor, Khris Brown, still hanging around! Causing trouble. Um... watching these credits, you get that weird feeling-- Like usually, you don't do stuff in sequence. You don't work from the beginning of the game to the end. You work on all parts, all around, usually. But this is the one thing where, like, these ending credits were the things we were doing... Like wiring this up happened the night before we shipped, or something, like we were really... And so we didn't-- We were like, "Can you approve the credits?" And we're just watching and we're like super tired, we gotta ship this game. Like, "Yeah, they look good. Yeah."
cocr0202	Tim: Race cat names by the "Grim Fandango" team. Oh, there were some race cat names that happened with the-- I sent out a message like, "Hey, can you guys help me think of--"
cocr0203	Peter M: Oh, that's right! The "Secrets of the Luftwaffe" theme. I'd forgotten Mike's theme was in there.
cocr0204	Tim: Wait, where is the--
cocr0205	Peter M: I think it's in the-- I think it might be in the blimp music?
cocr0206	Tim: That's an interesting--
cocr0207	Peter M: Yeah, I forgot all about that.
cocr0208	Tim: Me, I don't remember that even happening. You know I didn't play a lot of SWOTL. I played "Battle Britain," but not a lot of SWOTL.
cocr0301	Tim: ... and the box. But um, but yeah, so when you watch it I totally remember that weird last night feeling of... production. Which is always really weird, especially with the disc-based stuff. Before, the idea-- Now we think, "Ah, we'll fix it, we'll patch it," you know. I mean, we totally care about the quality of the game of course, but if something really, really bad happened, we'd patch it. But in a disc-based game, we weren't as into patching. It could happen but it-- So you really were like, "Oh God, this is-- I'm so nervous to ship this thing." Like saying it's done, saying you're not gonna fix any more bugs. It's done done was so much more final. So these last few days when you've just done everything you can for the game and you're just trying to wire the credits together in the last few minutes... So I'm feeling that stressful feeling right now.
cocr0302	Peter M: You know, it's the first ninety percent of a game is no big deal. It's the second ninety percent that's the tough...
cocr0303	Tim: Nice.
cocr0304	Peter M: That's the tough part. That's kind of--
cocr0305	Tim: Denise Gollaher! Still works at Double Fine. There you go.
cocr0401	Peter M: Steve Dauterman.
cocr0402	Tim: I'm not gonna mention any of those names. What? No, Steve Dauterman, he worked--
cocr0403	Peter M: He works in, uh--
cocr0404	Tim: He went to Australia but now he's somewhere else.
cocr0405	Peter M: Oh yeah. No, I just talked to him.
cocr0406	Tim: Alan Dundes... Alan Dundes was my anthropology teacher in Berkeley, where I learned about the Day of the Dead, that started this whole crazy thing. Spinray is, uh... you.
cocr0407	Peter M: Yeah, that's my band. What was that, what were you doing in there? Probably just special thanks.
cocr0408	Tim: These are special thanks, and the team got to pick--
cocr0409	Peter M: Yeah, 'cause they're kinda like my family. So when I wasn't at rehearsal, I think like-- Thanks for putting up with me not being there.
cocr0410	Tim: And I'm sure it meant a lot to them when they played this game. That's what I always say about the cats. One of my pet peeves, I hate cat and pet "thank yous" in credits.
cocr0411	Peter M: Oh yeah.
cocr0412	Tim: 'cause I'm like, okay, even if the cat figured out how to use Steam. Even if the cat figured out how to download this game--
cocr0413	Peter M: No that-- Good point.
cocr0414	Tim: How would they-- Would they even finish adventure-- How would they get past the sign post puzzle? Like that, there's no way a cat could get that far. They're not gonna see this-- Your "thank you."
cocr0501	Peter M: It's true. And probably they were just hanging out and enjoying themselves anyway.
cocr0502	Tim: Yeah. They have-- No way they'd have the patience for an adventure game. So with that thought, there we go. That's wrapping up the final... Thanks everybody for playing. Thanks for buying the remaster, or pirating it, however you got it. And thanks, Peter McConnell, for still working on games with me.
cocr0503	Peter M: Yeah, alright.
cocr0504	Tim: It's been a long time.
cocr0505	Peter M: Thank you.
cocr0506	Tim: I've learned a lot about "Grim Fandango" in this session, like how many times you got that one piece of music to work out for you. That was amazing. And it was really fun watching it again. And now I know how to solve all the puzzles for when I do my Let's Play of it, I'll actually act like I know what I'm doing. I don't wanna leave now 'cause I like the way my voice sounds.
cocr0507	Peter M: It's like basking in the glow, isn't it?
cocr0508	Tim: I wish everyone could hear me this clearly and loudly all the time. Alright! Thank you for playing. I'll say that now 'cause we never used to put that in the credits, and we do every time now, so we'll just say it now.
cocr0509	Peter M: Thanks for listening, too.
cocr0510	Tim: No one's gonna listen to this.
cocr0511	Peter M: Ah, that's right.

hqsa076	Potom zrejme posunie prípad Dominovi Hurleyovi, ktorý zah½adí stopy...
hqma077	Tak¾e ten menso DOSTÁVAL v¹etkých dobrých klientov!
hqsa078	Aj ty si mal nieko½kých, Manuel, len si to nevedel.
hqsa079	Domino dostal prípad iba ak ¾ivot klienta bol oèividne bezúhonný...
hqma080	Ako Meche...
hqma081	Viete kto je za tým?
hqsa082	Copal a Hurley to nemohli spravi» bez pomoci niekoho z hora.
hqsa083	V tejto hre vystupuje mocný hráè, ktorého identita mi zostáva záhadou.
hqma084	Èo odo mòa chcete?
hqsa085	Vybudujem tajnú armádu du¹í na boj proti nespravodlivosti, ktorú som videl v El Marrow.
hqsa086	Ako sa Aliancia stratených du¹í rozrastie, komunikácia sa stane nevyhnutnos»ou.
hqsa087	Potrebujeme spo½ahlivých poslíèkov.
hqma088	Chcete, aby som bol va¹ím poslíèkom?
hqsa089	Nie, Manuel. Je nás málo a na¹i agenti sú príli¹ cenní na to, aby riskovali pri takej práci.
hqsa090	História ukazuje len jedno rie¹enie v situáciách, ako je na¹a:
hqsa091	PO©TOVÉ HOLUBY!
hqma092	Tak¾e ak chytím zopár holubov zo strechy, necháte ma ís»?
hqsa093	Nie, potrebujem ich vychova» od narodenia. Agent Calavera...
hqsa094	Potrebujem, aby si mi doniesol ich vajcia!
hqma095	Dr¾íte ma tu, preto¾e potrebuje¹ vajcia?
hqsa096	Preèo si stále tu, Calavera?
hqsa097	Choï mi zohna» vojenské letectvo, kým sa e¹te nevyliahlo!
hqma098	Ja s tým konèím.
hqsa099	Zbohom, Agent Calavera, a...
hqsa100	Tak, to je celá in¹truktá¾, ktorú potrebuje¹, vojak!
hqsa101	Viva la Revolución!
hqma001	Tak¾e ty nie si len sekretárka, èo?
hqev002	Som ¹pión, Manny.
hqma003	No, tak to je posledný krát, èo vyu¾ívame tú pracovnú agentúru.
hqma004	Preèo mi nepomô¾e¹ dosta» sa odtia½to?
hqev005	Potrebujem tvoje zuby, spomína¹ si?
hqma006	U¾ som spomínal, ¾e s tebou rád pracujem?
hqev007	Detto.
hqma008	Mám tu projekt malého vozidla, ktorý by som ti rád ukázal.
hqma009	Nejaký odkaz pre mòa?
hqev010	Áno: "Pridaj sa alebo zomri!"
hqma011	Ale veï u¾ som màtvy...
hqev012	Znovu!
hqma013	Eva, musí¹ ma dosta» z mesta. Chcú zo mòa spravi» záhon!
hqev014	Nemô¾e¹ odís», Manny.
hqev015	Potrebujeme sa dosta» do poèítaèovej siete Ministerstva smrti, aby sme sa vôbec niekedy dozvedeli, èo sa vlastne deje.
hqev016	Bez obchodníka, èo si aj ty, sa tam nedostaneme. Poèítaè vás identifikuje pri prihlasovaní.
hqma017	Ako to robí?
hqma018	Odtlaèky prstov?
hqma019	Veï ¾iadne nemám!
hqev020	Tvoje zuby, Manny. To si si nikdy nev¹imol, ¾e ti poèítaè pri prihlasovaní skenuje zuby?
hqma021	Myslel som, ¾e je to len nárazový prúd.
hqev022	Potrebujeme tvoje zuby, Manny. Nemô¾eme »a necha» odís».
hqev023	Bohu¾ia½.
hqma024	Copala netrápi kde si?
hqev025	Don a Domino sú obaja zavretý v Donovej kancelárii s nejakým ve½kým zviera»om z hora.
hqev026	Nejaký tlstoprd.
hqsa027	Hmmmm. Som zvedavý, kto je ten tls»och a ako zapadá do tejto zlovestnej skladaèky.
hqev028	Mimochodom, nech »a ani nenapadne vyrabova» Dominov bar.
hqev029	Potrebujeme triezvych vojakov.
hqma030	Dobre.
hqma031	Ako dlho si ¹piónkou?
hqev032	Salvador ma naverboval asi pred rokom.
hqev033	Nemohla som mu odola». Je taký... vzne¹ený!
hqma034	Na èom to pracuje¹?
hqev035	Sna¾ím sa opravi» toto rádio, aby sme ho mohli pou¾i» v teréne.
hqev036	Ale vyzerá to beznádejne.
hqev037	Salvador má pravdu. Potrebujeme starých dobrých po¹tových holubov na komunikáciu s na¹imi agentmi v teréne.
hqma038	Vy máte agentov v teréne?
hqev039	Nie, zatia½ som to len ja a Sal, ale jedného dòa, Manny...
hqma040	Ja s tým konèím.
hqev041	Bojuj sa správnu vec, zlato.
hqma042	Tak¾e mi nepomô¾e¹ dosta» sa odtia½to?
hqev043	Smola. TEBE by som aj pomohla, ale nie tvojim zubom.
hqev044	E¹te si to premysli.

rfma007	Nieèo tam je.
rfma008	Je to súèas» strechy!

rfma028	A okrem toho, Salvador ich potrebuje vychova» od narodenia.
rfma029	He¹!
rfma030	Hmmm. Nevyzerajú vystra¹ene.
rfma031	Myslím, ¾e sa mi dokonca vysmievajú.
rfma032	Mo¾no nevedia, o ko½ko je dingo stra¹idelnej¹í od obyèajného psa.
rfma033	Holuby utekajte! To je Robert Frost!
rfma034	Zah½aïte sa do tohto ¾iariaceho kameòa. Va¹e vieèka sa zatvárajú...

rfma036	Èo je s vami? Ste príli¹ blbé na zhypnotizovanie?
rfma037	To by ich mohlo vystra¹i»...
rfma038	Vy nebojácni neoperenci.
rfma039	Pozor, aby som sa vás týmto nedotkol!
rfma040	Je to celé pokryté zárodkami Domina Hurleya!

lmve082	A èo tie nástroje, kde ich máte?
lmma083	Sú príli¹ »a¾ké na to, aby som ich nosil so sebou.
lmma084	Glottis ich donesie keï sa nalodíme.
lmve085	Hmmm.
lmve086	A ten preukaz, uká¾te ho.
lmve087	Uch-och.
lmve088	Óch... Charlie ho vyrobil trochu narýchlo...
lmve089	E¹te¾e je vá¹ nový kapitán ïalekozraký!
lmve090	Tu¹ím ste pripravený na odchod, Manny!
lmve091	Okrem jednej veci. Kde je ten vá¹ klavirista?
lmma092	Usporiadal si men¹iu rozlúèkovú párty.
lmma093	Hneï ho zo¾eniem.
lmve094	Povedzte mu nech sa ponáh½a! Limbo bez neho nemô¾e odpláva»!
lmve095	Hmmm, stále pre vás nemám na palube miesto.
lmve096	Naranja si to odskáèe keï sa vráti, ale hlavné je, ¾e tu bude.
lmve097	Stále niè neviem o Naranjovi, ale také nieèo sa u¾ stalo aj predtým.
lmma098	Ale stále som prvý v poradovníku?
lmve099	Keï sa to tak vezme, áno.
lmve100	Ech, a ten odborársky preukaz, Manny...
lmma101	To nie je problém, akurát som ho nechal v druhom kabáte.
lmve102	Dobre, u¾ sa te¹ím kedy mi ho uká¾ete.
lmve103	A nezabudnite, ¾e Glottis si musí prinies» vlastné nástroje.
lmma104	Donesie si. On by nikdy nikam ne¹iel bez mno¾stva nástrojov.
lmve105	Dobre, lebo ani Limbo!
lmve106	Nepostávajte tu len tak, lebo vás zo¾erú fúzonô¾ky!
lmma107	Správne!
lmma108	Úch, je to tu stra¹idelné.
lmtx109	velasco
lmma110	Správca dokov Velasco vyzerá ako starý morský vlk.
lmve111	Ech he he, a to ste e¹te nevideli jeho ¾enu!
lmma112	Hej, námorník.
lmve113	Prestaòte sa tu poneviera».
lmve114	Jasné, to znie ako dobrá rada.

lmve117	Áno, nu¾, na budúci tý¾deò je tá výstava plavidiel, viete, tak¾e...
lmma160	To je to, èo tomu chýbalo: napodobenina morskej vody!
lmma161	Èlovek by tak nejak èakal, ¾e po dvoch rokoch u¾ bude ma» vo f½a¹i aspoò záchranné èlny parníka Húser.
lmma118	Hej, pozrime sa...
lmve119	Rozmlátim vám to o hlavu ak sa za tým e¹te raz naèiahnete!
lmma165	Zvykol som sa zaobera» väè¹ími problémami.
lmma162	Mo¾no mu to pomô¾em dokonèi».
lmma163	Aj by som to vypil, ale parník Húser by mi pravdepodobne uviazol v krku.
lmma120	Poèkajte, hneï vám s tým pomô¾em...
lmve121	Ach!
lmve122	Sú isté veci, ktoré mu¾ musí urobi» sám!
lmtx123	gate
lmve124	Ja viem. Ja som ju zamkol!
lmtx125	limbo
lmma126	Parník Limbo potrebuje trochu láskavej starostlivosti.
lmma127	Jasné, mo¾no si to Velasco nev¹imne...
lmma128	Nikdy som nebol dos» dobrý v skoku vysokom.

lmve003	Na èom?
lmma004	Na Limbo, èloveèe, poïme!
lmve005	Manny, Manny, Manny... Limbo nie je osobná loï!
lmve006	Limbo nie je osobná loï!
lmve007	Vozíme len malé náklady a ¾iadna ruka na palube sa nefláka.
lmma008	Ani ja sa nebudem!
lmve009	A èo zvládate?
lmma010	Predaj a mana¾ment re¹taurácii.
lmve011	Och... hej, máme JEDNO vo½né miesto v posádke...
lmma012	Hej?
lmve013	Hej, v strojovni. Ten vá¹ Glottis by sa na to perfektne hodil!
lmve014	Ale musel by si donies» vlastné nástroje...
lmma015	OK, ak zo¾eniem Glottisovi nejaké nástroje, mô¾eme sa nalodi»?
lmve016	Uch, ON sa mô¾e, áno.
lmve017	Bez urá¾ky, Manny, jednoducho pre vás nemám na Limbo miesto.
lmve018	Posádka je u¾ kompletná.
lmve019	Pravdupovediac, celá posádka je na palube, pripravená vypláva» na úsvite...
lmve020	...okrem toho jedného maníka...
lmma021	Ktorý maník sa zatia½ nenalodil?
lmve022	Dobre, no tak námorník Naranja trochu me¹ká, ale kým vyplávame, bude tu.
lmma023	A èo robí Naranja na lodi?
lmve024	Stará sa o kuchyòu...
lmma025	Aha! Mana¾ment re¹taurácie!
lmve026	Hej, je to podobné tomu èo robíte teraz, akurát na Limbo sú ryby èerstvej¹ie.
lmma027	A èo keï sa Naranja neuká¾e? Mô¾em po òom nastúpi», správne?
lmve028	Manny, ani nie ste v námorníckych odboroch!
lmma029	Ja o tom viem, vy o tom viete, ale my predsa doká¾eme udr¾a» tajomstvo, nie?
lmve030	Glottis je výnimka, ale predák si vypýta VÁ© preukaz a keï ho nebudete ma»...
lmve031	...dostanú vás ¾raloky na desiatu a èo je hor¹ie...
lmve032	Ja dostanem pokutu!
lmve033	Sú to dos» nekompromisné odbory, chlapèe. A ja sa do nich rad¹ej nevàtam!
lmma034	Tak¾e na rovinu...
lmma035	Ak zo¾eniem Glottisovi nástroje...
lmve036	Potom mô¾e nastúpi» do strojovne na Limbo.
lmma037	...a keï sa Naranja neuká¾e v práci...
lmve038	Èo sa nestane.
lmma039	...a k tomu získam preukaz námorníckych odborov...
lmve040	...èo sa vám nikdy nepodarí.
lmma041	Potom mô¾em ráno vypláva» na Limbo?
lmve042	Ááách jaj.
lmve043	ASI HEJ.
lmma044	Aké nástroje potrebuje Glottis?
lmve045	Len znaèkové "Nástroje morských vèiel".
lmma046	Kde zo¾eniem "Nástroje morských vèiel"?
lmve047	Preèo sa nespýte morskej vèely?
lmve048	Bojíte sa, ¾e vás po¹típe?
lmve049	HA HA HA, HA-HA!!!
lmma050	Naranja sa u¾ ukázal?
lmve051	Nie, ale Toto Santos volal, ¾e ho práve vyniesli z jeho podniku.
lmma052	Tak¾e nie je schopný plavby, správne?
lmve053	Manny, mo¾no je namol, ale urèite nie TAK namol.
lmve054	Uch, nie. Ale doteraz e¹te nikdy nezme¹kal odchod!
lmma055	Kde myslíte, ¾e by Naranja mohol by»?
lmve056	Asi bude doma a pripravuje recepty na plavbu.
lmma057	Ako mô¾em èo najrýchlej¹ie vstúpi» do odborov?
lmve058	Manny, do tých odborov sa ½udia sna¾ia dosta» celé mesiace...
lmve059	...teda tí, èo to skú¹ajú poctivo.
lmve060	Ale, he, tak vám poviem... Je mi dos» jedno èi ten vá¹ preukaz bude alebo nebude úplne kó¹er...
lmve061	Akurát by mal vyzera» seriózne, chápete ma?
lmma062	Myslím, ¾e hej.
lmma063	Tak¾e, kde mô¾em získa» falo¹ný odborársky preukaz?
lmve064	Sklapnite, èloveèe, niè som nepoèul!
lmma065	Ale povedali ste...
lmve066	Také nieèo som nikdy nepovedal!
lmve067	V uliciach tohoto mesta sa skrýva plno nie úplne poctivých ½udí, ktorí zo¾enú skoro èoko½vek èo èlovek potrebuje...
lmve068	Ale ja nepoznám ani jedného!
lmma069	Èo to tam máte v tej f½a¹i? Nejaký remorkér?
lmve070	Náhodou je to presná zmen¹ená replika parníka Húser!
lmve071	Akurát mám trochu problémy tuto s týmto palubným nosníkom, nechce prejs» cez hrdlo f½a¹e, aha...
lmma072	Hm, èo je dos» zvlá¹tne, keï¾e húser väè¹inou spôsobuje problémy práve na opaènom konci tela...

bigu041	Prepáète, Manny.

bisl055	Salvador Limones je rozprávka, stra¹iak, ktorého pou¾ívajú tí hore na upokojenie tých dolu...
bial056	Idiot!
bial057	Salvador Limones je ve½mi skutoèný a ve½mi vynikajúci, vynikajúci èlovek.

bima094	Keby som môj klub rad¹ej nazval TAKTO!
bima095	Ale nie, musel som ho nazva» po sebe, ako idiot.

bima097	Ja sa nemie¹am do Oliviiných vecí, ona sa nemie¹a do mojich. Tak znie dohoda.
bima098	Volá sa Olivia Ofrenda.
bima099	Nie Maxove dievèa. V ¾iadnom prípade.
biol100	Èo sú tieto? Kto je Salvador Limones?
bima101	Olivia, èo si to za revolucionára?
biol102	Kto povedal, ¾e som revolucionár?
biol103	V ka¾dom prípade by som si to mala na¹tudova», mohlo by to zapôsobi» na zákazníkov...

biol223	Och, no tak, nezaèínaj.
bima224	Èo mô¾e¹ robi» s takým hadom ako je Nick?
biol225	Vysvetlila by som ti to, Manny, ale, hm, nemyslím, ¾e by si to pochopil.
bima226	Zapleta» sa s právnikom svojho dos» dôverného priate½a je dos» nebezpeèné.
biol227	Och, mo¾no som sa mýlila...
biol228	Predsa to chápe¹!
bima229	Robím si trochu starosti o Lolu...
biol230	To bude preto, lebo je stratená, Manny.
biol231	Za½úbila sa do Maximina!
biol232	Túto chybu som ja nikdy neurobila.
bima233	Myslí¹, ¾e by jej Nick mohol ublí¾i»?
biol234	Len ak ju nájde. A mô¾e¹ mi veri» - h½adanie nieèoho nie je jeho silná stránka.
bima235	Noc anonymných umelcov je tu¹ím ve½ký hit.
biol236	V¾dy to chví½u trvá, kým plaché du¹e pozbierajú odvahu.
bima237	Mo¾no by pomohlo, keby si sa tam postavila a rozhýbala publikum?
biol238	Och, Manny.
biol239	Mám èíta» poéziu vo vlastnom klube?
biol240	Celý klub by sa zvrhol na chrám pre ½udí, ktorí ma uctievajú.
bima241	Ale no tak. Len jedna báseò. Ako príklad hanblivým de»om.
bima242	Ale no...
bima243	A èo takto e¹te jednu?
biol244	Som vyèerpaná do morku kostí, v¹etky básne sa minuli.

biol246	Skutoène?
bima247	Je tu trochu tma, nemyslí¹?
biol248	Tma a zima, ako v srdci mu¾a.
bima249	Uch...
bima250	Vie¹, rozmý¹½am ¾e toto miesto kúpim.
biol251	Vá¾ne, rozmý¹½ala som chví½u ¾e kúpim to tvoje.
biol252	Ale potom som sa rozhodla poveda» Maxovi aby ho kúpil pre mòa on.
bima253	Mô¾e¹ ho ma». Odchádzam z mesta.
biol254	Manny!
biol255	Zrazu znie¹ tak vzru¹ene.

biol292	Dobre, posledná, ½udia.

mnch047	To hej, to je fajn.
mnch048	Akrylový?
mnma049	Nie, prírodný.
mnch050	Och, to je blbé. Prírodné vlákna sú pod vodou ve½mi nepohodlné.
mnma051	Viem, viem...
mnma052	Myslím, ¾e je to nejaký druh modrozelenej riasy.
mnch053	Á, netrápte sa tým. Na to si zvyknete.

drdo007	Hej, ¹portovec. Ako ide ten oné, útek?
drma008	Èo si s òou spravil?
drdo009	Myslel som, ¾e potrebovala trochu, ehm, "oddychu", to je v¹etko.
drma010	V poriadku. Je èas pusti» Meche von z trezoru.
drdo011	Och, obyèajne ju tam musím necha» cez noc, aby sa SKUTOÈNE uk½udnila.
drma012	Myslí¹, ¾e zlomí¹ jej vô½u len tým, ¾e ju na noc zatvorí¹?
drdo013	Nie, ale nedostatok èerstvého vzduchu ju pribrzdí nato½ko, ¾e mô¾em otvori» dvere...
drdo014	...bez obáv.
drma015	Zabil si môjho najlep¹ieho priate½a.
drdo016	Toho démona?
drdo017	(vzdych) Manny, démona mô¾e¹ vyu¾íva» ako ¹oféra, mô¾e ti nosi» správy, servírova» ti jedlo...
drdo018	...ale nikdy nesmie¹ o nich rozmý¹½a» ako o priate½och. Je to neprirodzené.
drma019	Èo tu robí¹, na okraji sveta?
drdo020	Och, viem. Ka¾dý deò sa to pýtam sám seba.
drdo021	Ale zauèím »a, Manny, aby si to tu po mne prevzal a riadil túto úbohú továreò na ¾iarovky!
drma022	Ako mô¾e¹ dr¾a» malé deti v klietke?
drdo023	Ver mi, je to jednoduch¹ie, ako udr¾a» v klietke VE¼KÉ deti.
drma024	Preèo zo mòa jednoducho nespraví¹ kvetinu, ako si sa o to pokú¹al v Puerto Zapato?
drdo025	To som nebol ja, to Hector.
drdo026	Má tak málo fantázie. Chcel len dokonèi» rozpracované, vie¹?
drdo027	Ale ja napriek tomu verím, ¾e sa mô¾e¹ rehabilitova» èestnou prácou!
drma028	Ako si mô¾e¹ myslie», ¾e budem pre teba pracova»?
drdo029	No, na tomto ostrove sa nedá robi» niè, len pracova», to ti teda poviem!
drdo030	A popremý¹½aj o tom. Keï odídem, bude¹ tu len ty a Meche na tomto opustenom ostrove...
drdo031	Nevrav, ¾e sa ti tá predstava nepáèi.
drma032	Nemám v pláne by» na tomto ostrove ve½mi dlho.
drdo033	Manny, vlastním v¹etky zbrane, v¹etky dopravné prostriedky...
drdo034	...v¹etky mozgy.
drdo035	Èo mieni¹ urobi»?
drma036	Ty s Hectorom ste vybudovali tajnú skrý¹u, aby ste vyrábali ¾iarovky?
drdo037	Ó, nie, to je len ved½aj¹í efekt.
drdo038	Skutoèný dôvod je ma» miesto, kde mô¾eme mojich bývalých klientov dr¾a» pod zámkou.
drdo039	Nemô¾eme predsa necha» dobrých ½udí vo½ne pobehova» po Krajine màtvych...
drdo040	...aby ka¾dému povedali, ako sme im ukradli ich lístky na Èíslo devä», nemyslí¹?
drma041	Vy ste v¹etkým dobrým ½uïom ukradli lístky?
drdo042	OK, ko½ko toho e¹te nevie¹, Calavera?
drdo043	Copal ku mne nasmeroval v¹etkých dobrých klientov, hneï ako presunul ich lístky do tajného fondu...
drdo044	Ja som zahladil stopy po spisoch, a potom sme zaistili, aby holúbok "padol cez palubu" he he, u Perly.
drma045	Vedel som to! NAOZAJ si dostával v¹etkých dobrých klientov!
drdo046	Postaral som sa o v¹etkých okrem Mercedes, ktorú si mi uniesol v tom smie¹nom fáre...
drdo047	ktoré som, mimochodom, naposledy videl v Rubacave.
drdo048	To ti poviem, Manny, také fára sa mi nezdajú bezpeèné...
drma049	Tak¾e to nebola moja chyba, ¾e Meche nedostala lístok. Vy ste ho ukradli!
drdo050	No, je to tvoja chyba, ¾e neskonèila hneï tu, ale v lese...
drdo051	Ale napravil som to.
drma052	Beriem Meche preè z tejto kobky.
drdo053	Manny, predtým ako som ju na¹iel, strávila rok v Skamenenom lese sama, kvôli tebe...
drdo054	Len pre porovnanie, povedal by som, ¾e tu v tejto "kobke" sa má pohodlnej¹ie, èo povie¹?
drma055	Jeden lístok pre teba, jeden pre Hectora, ko½ko ich e¹te potrebujete?
drdo056	Och, Manny, nikdy sme sa ich nedotkli!
drdo057	Predávame lístky du¹iam ne¹»astníkov...
drdo058	...ktorí nemohli vies» morálne ¾ivoty, preto¾e boli stvorení pre ohromné mno¾stvo peòazí.
drma059	Ale veï ste len mohli zobra» lístky a zmiznú»!
drdo060	Na¹li sme spôsob, ako spravi» ¾ivot v Krajine màtvych ZNESITE¼NÝ. Preèo by sme chceli odís»?
drma061	Má¹ tu pekný ostrov.
drdo062	Veru. Predchádzajúci majitelia nevedeli, èo tu majú. Bol za babku.
drdo063	Vy»a¾ili v¹etok koral, kam a¾ doèiahli so ¾eriavom, a potom opustili továreò!
drdo064	Ale my sme vedeli, ¾e máme prostriedky na to, aby sme sa dostali a¾ k okraju ve½kého útesu.
drma065	Chce¹ ma zase pouèova» o tajomstve úspechu?
drdo066	Nie!
drdo067	Práca otrokov, Manny!
drdo068	To je skutoèná cesta k úspechu!
drma069	No, musím sa vráti» k pokusu o útek.

sygl109	Nebojte sa, kapitán!
sygl110	Sme tu v bezpeèí.
sylh111	OK, tak¾e rozlo¾me tie výbu¹niny a vypadnime sakra odtia½to!
sygl112	Manny? Je to...

syma117	©¹¹!
syma118	Nieèo sa deje.
sygl119	Manny?
sygl120	Èo sa deje?
syma121	Neviem, ale nepáèi sa mi ako sa na nás tá vec pozerá.
sypu122	Opatrne, Bibi.
sypu123	Nový ¹éf sa zobúdza.
syma124	Pozrite... Naèo je dobrý vz»ah bez dôvery?
hosmc125	Pravda. Vz»ah bez dôvery je asi taký prázdny...
hosmc126	...ako ZBRAÒ BEZ NÁBOJOV.
hosmc127	Tu¹ím ste si neuvedomili, ¾e bystré dievèa má za klobúkom v¾dy jeden náboj navy¹e...
hosmc128	...na zlé èasy.
hosmc129	Poïme, ideme.
syma130	Meche, neviete èo to...

hosdo138	Nu¾, nerád »a vidím odchádza», Manny, ale uch...
hosdo139	Dáma vyzerá, ¾e sa u¾ rozhodla.
hosmc200	Myslím to vá¾ne, zastrelím ho.
hosdo141	V poriadku!
hosdo142	Vlastne pre mòa ani nepracuje.
hosmc143	Ale ja som si myslela...
hosmc144	Tak zastrelím teba.
hosdo145	Nie, nezastrelí¹.
hosdo146	Si príli¹ dobrá, pamätá¹?
hosmc147	Nie som!
hosmc148	U¾ nie som dobrá!
hosmc149	Dostal si to zo mòa, keï si ma tu dr¾al ako väzòa!
hosmc150	Rozbijem »a ako falo¹nú vázu obdobia Ming!
hosmc151	Rozbijem...
hosdo152	Ách..
hosdo153	V poriadku, decká.
hosdo154	Hahahaha. Je ako bomba...
hosdo155	Ale noc v trezore zvyèajne zahasí jej rozbu¹ku.
syma156	Glottis?
syma157	Kam si ¹iel tentokrát?
syma189	Dios mío!
sygl190	On je...
syma201	OK, myslím, ¾e by som mohol tú stopu sledova» tadeto, ale potrebujem trochu svetla.

syma161	To neberiem.
syma162	To naozaj nechcem urobi».
syma206	Nie.
syma207	Nemyslím.
syma163	Neprenosné.
syma164	Mmmm.
syma165	Nedoèiahnem.
syma166	Je to prázdne.
syma167	Je to zamknuté.
syma168	Nepohnem s tým.
syma169	S èím?
syma170	Nemyslím, ¾e by to veci nejak objasnilo.
syma171	Nikto tam nie je.
syma208	No jasné!
syma209	Je to OBROVSKÉ.
syma210	Nie.
syma211	To by nebolo ve½mi pekné.
syma212	To je v rozpore s na¹imi pravidlami.
syma213	Mô¾e by», ale je to plné.
syma172	Nemienim dosta» pruh.
syma173	Dnes nepresúvam ¾iaden nábytok.
syma191	Teraz nie.
syma174	Nie kým sa pozerá.
syma214	Rad¹ej nie.
syma192	To by ma zrejme dostalo pred súd!
syma175	Takto sa to nepou¾íva.
syma176	No, to by bolo nieèo!
syma177	Moje vrecko na to nie je dos» ve½ké!
syma215	Od»ahovacie auto som si zabudol v mojom druhom obleku.
syma178	Toto nepotrebujem.
syma216	Keby som sa toho dotkol, skonèil by som s palèákmi z nezábudiek.
syma193	To u¾ som urobil.
syma194	U¾ mám.
syma217	To nepotrebujem.
syma195	Tá du¹a u¾ bola znesená zo sveta.
syma196	Démoni nemô¾u by» znesený zo sveta.
syma179	Je to dobre uchytené.
syma180	Je to tak ïaleko ako je to len mo¾né.
syma181	Je to priskrutkované.
syma182	Je to otvorené.
syma183	Je to zavreté.
syma184	To je rebrík.
syma185	Sme pod vodou, nie na Mesiaci.

intma01	Prepáète mi to zdr¾anie, pán Flores.
intma02	Som pripravený vzia» si vás.
intcl03	Vzia» ma? Vzia» ma kam?
intma04	No tak, no tak...
intma05	Nemusíte by» nervózny.
intcl06	Nervózny? Nie... To len, vá¹ výzor. Je, nu¾, trochu zastra¹ujúci...
intma07	Zastra¹ujúci? Ja? Ale veï ja som vá¹ priate½! Volám sa Manny Calavera. Som vá¹ nový cestovný agent!
intcl08	Nechcem nového cestovného agenta. Chcem ís» domov.
intma09	Ha ha! Nemô¾ete ís» domov, Celso. Ste màtvy. Ale nie ste jediný...
intma10	V¹etci sú tu màtvi presne ako vy.
intma11	Preto to tu voláme "Krajina màtvych".
intma12	Ste pripravený na ve½kú cestu?
intcl13	Nie.
intcl14	Akú cestu?
intma15	©tvorroènú "Cestu du¹e". Je to dos» dlhý výlet. A nebudem vám klama», Celso.
intma16	Mohlo by to by» ve½mi, ve½mi nebezpeèné.
intma17	Iba¾e... by ste vzali peniaze, s ktorými vás pochovali a kúpili si u nás lep¹í cestovný balíèek!
intma18	Myslím tým, nechceli by ste rad¹ej prejs» Krajinu màtvych vo vlastnom ¹portovom aute? Alebo skúsi» luxusnú zaoceánsku plavbu? Alebo, ak ste viedli skutoène VE¼MI DOBRÝ ¾ivot, boli by ste oprávnený dokonca na lístok na Èíslo devä»!
intcl19	Èíslo devä»?
intma20	To je ná¹ luxusný rýchlik. Trieli rovno do Deviateho podsvetia, Krajiny veèného odpoèinku, za ¹tyri minúty namiesto ¹tyroch rokov. Ale len ve½mi málo ½udí si ho zaslú¾i. Pozrime sa na va¹e záznamy.
intma21	Hmmm...
intma22	Hmmm... Nu¾, zlá správa je, ¾e na vlak zrejme nárok nemáte. Ale e¹te stále mám zopár trikov v rukáve...
intma23	Mmm-hmmm... Aha. Áno... To je ono...
intma24	..."PALICA EXCELSIOR".
intma25	Veru, je krásna. A ten kompas v rukoväti sa tie¾ zíde...
intma26	Och, budete ma» skvelý výlet. Bodaj by som ¹iel aj ja!
intcl27	Preèo nejdete? Mohli by ste ma odviez».
intma28	Och, ja nemô¾em odís» kým si neodpracujem malý dlh silám, ktoré...
intcl29	Verejnoprospe¹né práce, èo?
intcl30	No, aspoò niekto je na tom hor¹ie ne¾ ja.
intma31	Ó, ja odídem èoskoro!
intma32	Ale nie vïaka takýmto o nièom prípadom s nulovou províziou ako ty, kamo¹ko.
intev33	Hej, Manny. ©éf ti odkazuje, aby si dnes veèer nikam ne¹iel. Chce s tebou o nieèom hovori», keï sa vráti z cesty.
intma34	Povedz Donovi, nech nemá obavy...
intma35	...nikam sa nechystám.
intma36	Hlavne nie s klientmi ako henten!
intma37	Kde berú tých chlapíkov? Nezaslú¾ia si niè dobré, tak¾e im niè dobré nepredám, teda si neodpracujem svoj èas a trèím tu. Takto budem donekoneèna predáva» vychádzkové palice kope somárov.
intma38	Potrebujem lep¹ích klientov. Potrebujem skutoèného svätca. Musím sa nejako dosta» k bohatému màtvemu svätcovi.
lolma01	Eva, skús to pre mòa e¹te raz.
lolev02	V poriadku, ale zdá sa by» dos» na¹tvaný...
lolev03	Pán Copal? Pán Calavera tu má nieèo o èom tvrdí, ¾e potrebuje vá¹ podpis...
lolco04	"Kruci Eva! Podpí¹te to vy, dobre? Nemám èas!"
lolev05	Musí¹ ho ospravedlni», Manny. Asi dnes lú¹ti skutoène »a¾kú krí¾ovku.
lolma06	Eva, ja ¾asnem.
lolma07	Vôbec som netu¹il, ¾e má¹ takú moc.
lolev08	Nu¾, v¹etci máme svoje tajomstvá.
lolgl09	Grrrt. Ách.
lolgl10	Hej, v tomto vyzerám dobre, nie? He he.
lolma11	Hej, nu¾, hovorí sa, ¾e èierna zo¹tíh½uje...
lolgl12	Ja ¹oférujem! Áno! ©oférujem! RrrrrrrrmmmmmmAahaha!
lolgl13	Brrrrrrr!
lolma14a	Por favor.
brpma01	...ale ponúkame rôzne vylep¹enia k cestovnému balíèku, keby ste...
brpbo02	Netrepte. Chcem nieèo lacné, kde by som si odpoèinul, to je v¹etko.
brpma03	Aj aj aj.
brpgl04	Vie¹, Manny, mohol by som toto auto tro¹ku zrýchli», keby si chcel...
brpma05	Dobre, dobre, èo len chce¹.
brpgl06	Ó áno, odstránim prednú kapotu, roz¹írim zadnú èas», dvojité trysky po stranách!
brpgl07	Wah-wah-WAAAAAH! WAAAAAAAAHAAAAHHH!
brpma08	Takto si poriadne oddýchnete, pán Martinez a budete bezpeène zaliaty penou, ktorá vznikne zmie¹aním týchto dvoch chemikálii. Takto.
brpbo09	Ach, rozmyslel som si to, chcem si vylep¹i» svoj balíèek!
brpma10	Je mi ½úto, Bruno, ale na niè lep¹ie ste sa nekvalifikovali.
brpma11	Ale tu, vezmite si túto pamätnú ¹álku.
brpbo12	Nie! Poèka»! Nemô¾ete mi nájs» nieèo, kde by som mohol hýba» nohami?
brpma13	Viete, ¾e by som chcel, Bruno...
brpma14	...ale môj ¹éf je riadny zadubenec.
brpco15	Musím by» zadubenec, keï mám takých lenivých máchaèov kosáèikmi ako TENTO rozjarený chlapec èo pre mòa pracuje! Manny, ty nezo¾enie¹ klienta ani v jachtovom klube!
brpma16	Ale veï tu mám klienta!
brpco17	Hovorím o DOBRÝCH klientoch, Calavera! Takých, akých má Domino!
brpma18	Ako mám zohna» dobrých klientov, keï mi posielate takýchto vymetencov?
brpbo19	Hej!
brpco20a	Tak¾e teraz obviòuje¹ klientov? U¾ mám toho dos», Manny! Keï nezo¾enie¹ super klienta do nasledujúcej úètovnej závierky, letí¹!
brpbo21	Koho nazývate vymetenec? Preèo by som...
rm1ma01	Glottis! Èo ti preskoèilo? Èo to do teba vo¹lo? To bolo firemné auto!
rm1gl02	No hej! A teraz je e¹te lep¹ie firemné auto! Naskoè! Íííhahaha! Ú!
rm1ma03	Buenos días.
rm1me04	Vy nie ste sestrièka?
rm1ma05	Nie.
rm1me06	Nepri¹li ste mi da» môj liek?
rm1ma07	Nie, ale pri¹iel som vám zmierni» utrpenie.
rm1me08	Asi ma nedokázali zachráni», èo?
rm1ma09	Nie, ale stále je tu ¹anca, ¾e vy zachránite mòa.
rm3co01	Hej! Ty kostra! Do mojej pracovne! Hneï!
rm3co02	PO©KODIL si majetok spoloènosti, aby si sa dostal k TAJNEJ INFORMÁCII, tak¾e si nasadol do NELEGÁLNE MODIFIKOVANÉHO firemného auta s NEZAREGISTROVANÝM ©OFÉROM a vytlaèil tu Domina z cesty...
rm3co03	...len kvôli tomu, aby si ukradol klienta jej právoplatnému agentovi!
rm3ma04	Tu nie je niè právoplatné. V¹etkých dobrých klientov dostáva Domino.
rm3do11	Manny, hanbím sa za teba.
rm3co05	Zahanbil si celý úrad. Zavolám sem tú ¾enu, aby si sa jej mohol ospravedlni».
rm3co06	Eva, po¹lite sem sleènu Colomar, prosím.
rm3ev07	Odi¹la asi pred pätnástimi minútami, pane. Vravela, ¾e má pred sebou dlhú pe¹iu túru, tak¾e chce zaèa» èo najskôr.
rm3co08	Pe¹o! Mala lístok na Èíslo devä»! Preèo myslí¹, ¾e musí ís» pe¹o?
rm3ma09	To je to najlep¹ie, èo som pre òu dokázal nájs»...
rm3co11	Tá ¾ena bola svätica a kandidát na lístok na Èíslo devä», ktorý nedostane, preto¾e TY...
rm3co12	...si to nemohol nájs»! A vïaka tvojmu husárskemu kúsku je teraz tam vonku...
rm3co13	...osamelá...
rm3co14a	...kráèa sama Skameneným lesom èeliac démonom podsvetia nikým nechránená.
rm3co15	Zostane¹ tu pokia½ nám chlapci na ústredí nepovedia, èo s tebou urobíme. Niekto si to odpyká, Calavera. A nebudem to ja!
lq_ma01	Odhalím, èo sa tu deje!
lq_sv02	Mladý mu¾, si nepriate½om Ministerstva smrti!
lsasv01	Salvador Limones a hos».
lsama02	Kam ma to vedie¹?
lsasv03	Do ústredia ASD.
lsama04	ASD?
lsasv05	Aliancia stratených du¹í. Sme zatia½ len malá skupina, Manuel, ale stále h½adáme nových vojakov.
lsama06	Na èo presne ich chcete?
lsasv07	Potrebujeme pomoc v styènej jednotke. Evu samozrejme pozná¹.
lsasv08	Aj ja som bol kedysi kolegom Zubatej ako ty, Manuel. Ale odhalil som sie» korupcie v na¹om milovanom Ministerstve smrti.
lsasv09a	Mám dôvod veri», ¾e Úrad obstarávania podvádza práve tie du¹e, ktorým má slú¾i».
lsama10	Aké má¹ dôkazy?
lsasv11	To je, preèo si tu, Manuel. Alebo »a mám vola» "Agent Calavera"?
lsama12	"Manny" mi úplne vyhovuje. Nemám záujem vstupova» do ¾iadnej vojenskej organizácie, Sal. Ja len chcem naspä» svoju prácu, aby som si odpracoval svoj èas a vypadol z tejto stoky.
lsasv13a	Nu¾, bez mojej pomoci sa nedostane¹ ani z tohto mesta. Èo samozrejme znamená, ¾e nebude¹ môc» nájs» tú ¾enu a nikdy nedostane¹ svoju prácu naspä».
st1sv01	Musí¹ ís» do mesta Rubacava, priate½u, ak chce¹ nájs» svoju stratenú du¹u.
st1ma02	Odkia½ vie¹, kde je?
st1sv03	Neviem. Ale ka¾dý, kto sa chce dosta» do Deviateho podsvetia musí prejs» More nárekov, a teda musí ís» do Rubacavy, aby sa dostal na loï. Keï sa tam dostane¹ skôr ako ona, nájde¹ ju. Ale mô¾e to trva» dos» dlho.
st1ma04	Poèkám tak dlho, ako bude treba.
st1sv05	Manuel? Ty...
st1sv06	...ju miluje¹?
st1ma07	Láska? Láska je pre ¾ivých, Sal. H½adám ju len z jedného dôvodu...
st1ma08	...ona je môj lístok odtia½to.
cpddo01	Pán LeMans, uis»ujem vás, ¾e sa tá stratená ¾ena nájde. Ja osobne ju vystopujem.
cpdhe02	Tak, ako si ju osobne vyzdvihol z Krajiny ¾ivých?
cpddo03	To som mal v úmysle, ale agent Calavera sa k nej nejako dostal skôr.
cpdhe04	Dali sme ti najrýchlej¹ie auto, Domino. Dávali sme ti tých najlep¹ích klientov. Mal si v¹etky výhody, tak¾e ako sa tam ten Calavera votrel a zjedol ti tvoju veèeru?
cpdco05	Och, ale Hector, nemô¾ete by» ve½mi na¹tvaný na Domina. Nebola to jeho chyba...
cpdhe06	Ó, ale mô¾em, Don. Mal by si vedie», ¾e ja MÔ®EM by» ve½mi na¹tvaný. Ale nie na Domina. Koniec-koncov, on neriadil túto operáciu.
cpdhe07	Aspoò nie doteraz.
cpdco08	Hector! Nie!
cpdco09	Aggk!
cpdhe10	Nechtíky... Hm. Zvlá¹tne...
cpdhe11	Z nejakého dôvodu som oèakával tulipány. Nu¾, mo¾no pán Calavera, èo, Domino? Preèo nejde¹ osobne do gará¾e a neeskortuje¹ ho sem? Èím skôr rozkvitne a my sa budeme môc» vráti» k biznisu, tým lep¹ie.
cpdgl12	Ó SRDCE! SRDCE JE DOBRÉ! BUÏ K SRDCU DOBRÝ! NEVYTRHÁVAJ SI SRDCE! SRDCE JE DOBRÉ! SILNO TLÈÚCE DOBRÉ SRDCE. Hej, to je moje auto?
dbvma01	(nádych) Hej, u¾ dos»!
dbvgl02	Och? Liez» niekomu do kapusty? Ha ha!
dbvma03	Nechcem o tom hovori».
gtsgl01	Manny, doteraz sme sa plazili po zemi ako potkani. Ale odteraz sa budeme vzná¹a»! Ako orly! Veru! AKO ORLY... NA SKÁKACÍCH TYÈIACH!!!
gtsma02	Aká ú½ava. U¾ som sa bál, ¾e na¹a preprava nebola dos» nápadná.
gtsgl03	Nastúp! Alebo sa bojí¹ vý¹ok?
gtsma04	Nie, len nevo½nosti z pohybu.
hlrgl01	Zdravím!
hlrgl02	Sleèna Colomar!
hlrgl03	Pri¹li sme vás zachráni»!
hlrma04	Hej, nevrieskaj tak! Celé mesto spí!
hlrgl05	Ale ja chcem krièa»! Keï si v¹etci v¹imnú môjho auta, bude o nás hovori» celé mesto! He.
hlrma06	Má¹ pravdu. Musíme nájs» dobré miesto, kde by sme schovali túto parádu.
hlrma07	Keï sme pri schovávaní, zaujímalo by ma, èi je Meche u¾ tu. Idem preskúma» terén. Toto je celkom pekná nehnute½nos». Má potenciál...
plgma01	Áááá!
plgvl02	Ach, turisti!
plgvl03	Tu si musíte dáva» pozor, kam stúpate, cudzinec. Rubacava u¾ nie je malé podivné mesto, aké bývalo.
plgvl04	Nóóóó ho hóóó. Vyzerá to, ¾e je v meste nové vozidlo. Ospravedlòte ma, idem si ho obzrie»!
yr2lu01	Hej, ¹éfe! Mal by si ís» dole. Jeden zákazník sa na teba pýtal.
yr2ma02	Veï vie¹, ¾e sa nerád bavím so zákazníkmi.
yr2lu03	Nu¾, mo¾no by si sa rád pobavil s týmto.
shgma01	Meche?
shgme02	Manny. Pomô¾te mi. Bola som stratená tak dlho. Preèo ste ma neh½adali?
shgma03	H½adal! Vy ste utiekli!
shgma04	Preèo...
shgme05	Lebo ste povedali, ¾e som nebola dobrá. Bola som osamelá v tomto svete celý rok...
shgme06	A TO V©ETKO KVÔLI VÁM!
shgvl07	Bude to s vami takto ka¾dý rok, Manny? Ka¾dý Deò màtvych vrhnete svoje kosti do toho drinku a ja ich vylovím?
shgma08	Nemienim tu zosta» tak dlho, Velasco. Hneï ako zistím, kam ten zaoceánsky parník smeruje, idem po òom!
shgvl09	Ha! Tá loï ide do Puerto Zapato! To je na druhom konci sveta! Tým smerom nepláva ¾iadna loï okrem tejto starej Limbo...
shgvl10	...ale...
shgma11	Ale niè. Ak je Limbo moja jediná nádej, u¾ som na palube.
shgvl12	Nuuuuuuuu¾, ve½a ¹»astia, synku. To je v¹etko, èo mám k tomu poveda». Ho ho! Ha ha ha ha!
snama01	Lola? Èo tu robí¹? Tento dav nemá ve½ký záujem o fotky na pamiatku. Mo¾no okrem Leninovej...
snalo02	©¹¹! Manny, som na love! Doká¾em Maximinovi raz a nav¾dy, ¾e Olivia nie je preòho dobrá.
snama03	Stále visí¹ na Maxovi, èo? Prijmi moju radu, zlatko. Zabudni naòho. Je to hazardný podvodník.
snalo04	Ha ha. Ako ty?
snama05	Och, to bolí, bejby.
snalo06	©¹¹! U¾ vychádzajú!
snavi07	No tak, zlato. Èo tak bozk na rozlúèku.
snaol08	Ó, ick. Nesklam ma, Nick. Si právnik. Nepredpokladá sa, ¾e by si mal city.
snavi09	Nemám, ale rozpoznám dobrý delikt, keï ho zbadám.
snavi10	Hej!
snavi11	Keï to uvidí Maximino, skonèíme v priliehavých tehlovoèervených èrepníkoch!
snaol12	Nebuï smie¹ny.

lldlo05	Áno, ve½mi chcel tú fotku. Ale nikdy ju nenájde, ten hajzel.
lldma06	Dostanem ho, Lola. Uká¾em tú fotku Maxovi a nadobro zne¹kodním Nicka. Len mi povedz, kde si ju schovala.
lldlo07	Och, Manny. Je to len moja chyba. V¾dy narazím na nesprávnych chlapov. Vie¹, kedysi som mala o teba záujem. Ale ty stále visí¹ na tej Meche. Bolo mi jasné, ¾e nemám ¹ancu.
lldma08	Lola, kde ja tá fotka?
lldlo09	Povedz, Manny. Mala by som u teba ¹ancu?
lldlo10	Nevadí.
lldlo11	Len varuj Oliviu. Povedz jej, aby si zlep¹ila vkus na chlapov, lebo skonèí ako ja. Povedz jej, aby si na¹la milého chlapa, Manny, ako si ty...

brbbg03	Tu¹ím ste mysleli dvojku, nemám pravdu?
brbsn04	Uch, nie monsieur. ©trnástka vyhráva.
brbbg05	Tu¹ím ste sa pomýlili.
brbsn06	Je mi ½úto pane. ©trnástka je ví»azným èíslom. Viacej ¹»astia nabudúce.
brbbg07	To by staèilo! Ten Calavera sa nezmestí do ko¾e. Nerád robím... razie v podnikoch a zatváram ich, ale niekto musí da» Manuelovi lekciu z práva a poriadku.
brbbg08	Tadia½to, tu vzadu. Otvorte tie vagóny a zaènite ich napåòa». A nájdite niekto Calaveru. Rád by som ho osobne vypoèul!
brbgl10	Hej, no tak! Musíte ma tam pusti»! SOM VIP!
brbma11	To znamená "ve½mi impregnovaný pianista"?
brbgl12	Au, Manny. Ja u¾ nechcem by» pianista. Som mechanik!
brbma13	Ja viem. Preto som ti zohnal novú prácu. Poï. Vyzdvihneme tvoje náradie.
brbgl14	A mô¾em urobi» s motorom èo len chcem? Zrýchli» ho?

brbvl17	Sakra, po tom, èo sa stalo Naranjovi mi je jasné, preèo odchádzate z mesta. (vzdych) Len dúfam, ¾e vás nebudem musie» zasa vy»ahova» z drinku.
brbma18	Nabudúce u¾ zostanem pod hladinou, s½ubujem.

subgl13	Manny?
subma14	Ani sa nepýtaj, kamo¹, lebo neviem.
reuma01	Meche?
reume02	Manny! Èo tu robíte?
reuma03	Chcel som sa pozrie», ako pokraèuje vá¹ výlet, zlatko. SOM vá¹ cestovný agent, veï viete. Mimochodom, vïaka za tú f½a¹u ¹ampanského, èo ste mi poslali. Trafila klinec po hlavièke.
reume04	Hrnuli ste sa do pasce. Sna¾ila som sa vás varova». Domino ma pou¾il ako návnadu. Nechcela som, aby ste tu skonèili ako väzeò tak, ako ja.
reuma05	Väzeò? A kde máte celu? Alebo len zdie½ate komôrku s bacharom?
reume06	Ak si to o mne myslíte...
reume07	preèo ste sem pri¹li?
reudo08	Preto¾e sem patrí.
reudo09	Pracuje pre mòa.
reudo10	Vedel som, ¾e sem asi príde¹. Za ka¾dých okolností, Manuel Calavera je v¾dy s vyhrávajúcim tímom, ¾e Manny? Preto si teraz tu.
reuma11	Padám z tohto balvana a beriem so sebou v¹etkých týchto ½udí.
reudo12	Hahahahaha! Manny, z tohto ostrova sa nedá dosta». Obávam sa, ¾e tu zostane¹ na mojom malom riadite½skom tréningovom programe. Vie¹, preberie¹ to tu po mne, chlape. Musím sa dosta» spä» do mesta, kde sa nieèo deje.
reugl13	Prepáè, Manny, musel som vojs». Moja ple» zaèínala blednú».
reudo14	Jeho nepotrebujem.
reuma15	Za toto »a pomeliem na prach, cabrón.
reudo16	Mo¾no neskôr...

reuma18	Uf.
posgl01	Áno!
posma02	Nemô¾em uveri», ¾e si ju dokázal rozchodi». Neuverite½né! Ha ha ha!
posgl03	To bola tá ½ah¹ia èas». Problém bude predra» sa tým ve½kým koralovým útesom!
posma04	Predra» sa tým ve½kým koralovým útesom, èo? Hmmm...
posma05	Nu¾, tak sa stalo, ¾e mám pre teba na plá¾i nejaký kus materiálu, ktorý by »a mohol zaujíma»...
exoma01	Funguje to perfektne! Plnou parou vpred!
exodo02	Èo¾e?
exome04	Tak¾e, naozaj ma odvediete naspä» a pokúsite sa dosta» svoju bývalú prácu?
exoma05	Teraz mám len jedinú robotu. Odviez» vás a ka¾dého na palube na koniec cesty.
exome06	Ale keï ma nevyu¾ijete na získanie va¹ej práce, preèo ste ma celý ten èas h½adali?
exoma07	Meche, ja...

exodo09	Dám ti JEDNU prácièku, Manny!
exoma10	Uf.
exodo11	A hneï vidím, ako ju nezvláda¹!
exodo12	Hádam ti nemusím pripomína», ¾e toto sa objaví v tvojom hodnotení...

htrma01	Hej. Kde sú v¹etci?
htrgk02	Èakáreò èíslo dva!
htrma03	Ako dlho tam musia èaka»?
htrgk04	Kým nebudú ma» lístky! Dostali lístky na Èíslo devä», a teraz ich nemajú. Trest za predaj lístkov na Èíslo devä» je VE¼MI prísny.
htrma05	Ale oni nepredali svoje lístky. Oni im boli ukradnuté!
htrgk06	Kým?
htrma07	Hector LeMans ich ukradol, aby ich predal bohatým ½uïom, ktorí si ich nezaslú¾ia.
htrgk08	To by mohli by» oni. Pozrime sa, èo si zaslú¾ia.
htrma09	Èo do...
htrgk10	ONI aj tak nemali lístky. Neboli pravé, mimochodom.
htrma11	Falo¹né lístky? Tak preto Hector zhàòa v¹etky tie falo¹né lístky! Predáva ich namiesto pravých. Ale to potom znamená, ¾e e¹te stále má tie pravé...
bruma01	Bruno? Bruno Martinez?
brubo02	VY! To ste boli vy, èo ma do toho zabalil! Mohli ste mi da» aspoò èasopis! ©tyri roky s nièím na èítanie, okrem tohto poondeného hrnèeka!
brubo04	Padám odtia½to. Tento svet je pre cucákov.
cfrm101	Vystrelíme »a ako ¹íp po vetre. Aby si pre»al srdce samotného vetra a vypil krv letu.
cfrm202	Rýchlos» je pokrm Glottisa Ve½kého!
cfrm103	Rýchlos» ti vráti ¾ivot.
cfrm204	Raz sa k nám vrá»!
cfrme08	Si si istý, ¾e sa táto vec udr¾í pokope?
cfrma09	Uf, aspoò väè¹iu èas» cesty. Hej, pozri! U¾ sme v Rubacave!
cfrgl10	Och... Manny? MANNY? Manny, kde si?
cfrgl11	MANNY?!? JA SA BOJÍM!
cfrgl12	Ach, Rubacava! To je mesto! Pamätá¹ sa na staré èasy, Manny?
cfrma13	To u¾ je za nami, kamarát môj. Teraz tu pre nás u¾ niè nie je.
cfrgl14	Mo¾no okrem ná¹ho starého auta.
vmagl01	V poriadku! Nastal èas na trhanie asfaltu!
vmaol02	Ak idete po Hectorovi LeMansovi, potom ide s vami.
vmame03	Mô¾em sa s tebou podeli» o miesto.
vmame04	Myslím.
vmama05	Zdá sa, ¾e Hector ovládol celé mesto.
vmaol06	Nemal ve½ký odpor. Je tu len jedna malá skupinka, ktorá je proti nemu a tí ¾ijú na miestach v okrajovej èasti mesta.
vmama07	Myslí¹ miesta ako toto?
vmame08	Dúfam, ¾e neublí¾ia Glottisovi.
vmaol09	Ha! Aspoò vidno, ¾e ich vôbec nepoznáte! Ich vodca je skvelý mu¾, ktorý...
vmasv10a	Manuel Calavera. Opä» sa stretávame. Vidím, ¾e si na¹iel, èo si h½adal. Aká náhoda, ¾e si pri¹iel teraz, keï dosiahneme úspech.
vmaun11	Pasca! Bola to pasca!
vmasv12	Ustúpte! Dá sa urobi» len jedno.
vmame13	(vzdychy)
vmasv15	Èo si vravel o pasci?
vmaun16	Hector odhalil ná¹ho agenta vo vojenskom laboratóriu.
vmasv17	Nie!
vmahe18	Ty idiot, Bowlsley! Tvoj nový asistent je ©PIÓN!
vmahe19	Èo si nikdy nepoèul o PREVEROVANÍ OSÔB!
vmama20	Èo¾e?
vmasv21	Nie je èas na vysvet½ovanie. Teraz budem musie» zobra» veci do svojich rúk...
vmaol22	Zoberte ma zo sebou. U¾ roky tú¾im pomôc» va¹ej veci.
ebdbw01	Èo?
ebdbw02	Hectorov poslíèek...
ebdbw03	S o-odkazom p-pre mòa?
ebdbw04	"Viem, o èo ti ide... Neustále »a sledujem. Poèkaj chví½u. Idem z teba osobne spravi» záhon! S pozdravom, Hector LeMans." Vedel som to!!!
ebdbw05	V¾dy som vedel, ¾e raz po mne pôjde.
ebdbw06	Nikdy nenájde¹ moju tajnú skrý¹u, Hector. Bude¹ si musie» nájs» iného kvetinára!
odjhe01b	TY! To si ty presvedèil tých Floresovcov?
odjma02	©koda, ¾e ste to nevideli. Bolo to ako z ve½kej knihy.
odjhe03b	Poèkaj tu. Musím získa» zopár podpisov, ale potom »a chcem zobra» na malý výlet mestom.
odjhe01a	Rozprávam tu len o práci? Alebo vravím o príle¾itosti v be¾nom zmysle slova?
odjhe02	Toto by bola tvoja kancelária.
odjhe03	Tu. Vyskú¹aj si to. Skús ako sa v tom cíti¹. Aj to je tvoje.
odjhe04	A ako bonus naviac...
odjhe05	Dve percentá z týhto, pán ehm...
odjma06	Volám sa Calavera a mám vy¹¹ie ciele.
odjhe07	Hm-mm-mm, ha, uch, ach, och, ale pán Calavera... Budem potrebova» ve½kú èas» týchto tu, aby som sa dostal z tohto sveta. Vie¹, bol som ve½mi zlý chlapec. Ha ha!
odjma08	Odnesiem tieto lístky ich právoplatným majite½om...
odjma09	...a vás pridám do kompostu.
eldma01	Tento bude tvoj.
eldgl02	Nezabudni posla» pomoc!
eldme03	(výkrik)
eldma04	Aj! Uteè! Nájdi Salvadora!
eldol05	Nastúp, rýchlo!
eldma06	Mali sme tu ma» ochranku. Kde sú v¹etci Salvadorovi mu¾i?
eldol07	Ja neviem.
eldol08	E¹te mi to nepovedal.

svshe01	Má ma rada...
svshe02	...nemá ma rada...
svsma03	Nu¾, èiastoène máte pravdu.
svshe04	Och Manny... taký cynizmus... Èo sa ti stalo, Manny, ¾e si stratil cit pre nádej? Tvoja láska k ¾ivotu?
svsma05	Umrel som.
svshe06	Aha, mm-mm-mm, tu¹ím mal Domino pravdu. Nemá¹ v sebe ani kúsok optimizmu.
svsma07	No, keï u¾ sme pri kúskoch, Dom je na ne expert.
svshe08	A pou¾ijúc rovnakú logiku, Manny, ty sa zrejme stane¹ expertom na botaniku.
svsma09	Tak teraz nastala tá chví½a, keï mi poviete v¹etko o va¹om tajnom pláne, Hector? Ako ste nevinným du¹iam ukradli lístky na vlak Èíslo devä», ako¾e ste ich predávali, ale v skutoènosti ste ich hrabali pre seba v zúfalej snahe dosta» sa z Krajiny màtvych?
svshe10	Nie.
svshe11a	Hi-ach, ha, ha... Teraz nastala tá chví½a, keï sa bude¹ zvíja» v obrovských bolestiach skoro celú hodinu, preto¾e ten idiot Bowlsley zdrhol so v¹etkou rýchlokvitnúcou chemikáliou.

endma04	Démoni idú zadarmo, ¾e?
endgl05	Och, Manny. Vie¹, ¾e nemô¾em ís» s tebou. Som bytos» zeme a to v¹etko. Nikdy neopustím tento svet.
endma06	Tu¹ím som sa tak zamotal do zachraòovania ½udí, a¾ som si myslel, ¾e zachránim aj teba.
endgl07	Hej, ale mòa... mòa netreba zachraòova». Páèi sa mi tu. U¾ nie som osamelý v tom suteréne, vïaka tebe. Mám novú prácu a týchto nových priate½ov. Som ve½ký démoní úspech.

endma17	Vie¹, zlatko... Keï som sa nieèo nauèil, je to toto: Nikto nevie, èo sa nakoniec stane, tak¾e si ten výlet vychutnajme.
tmpts01	Hej! Zavrite dvere! Spomalili ste mi tetovaèku, to je ve½mi bolestivé! Ve½mi bolestivé, èo Naranja? Ako muèenie, èo?
